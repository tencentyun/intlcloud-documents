## Notes
- The Flow Logs (FL) service is only available to the ENI in VPC, while the flow logs of classic network-based CVM, database, gateway, peering connection and other services cannot be collected.
- The configurations of a flow log cannot be modified after creation. For example, the cloud log service (CLS) to which the flow log is published cannot be modified.
- FL does not support capturing the following IP traffic:
  - Traffic generated by Windows instances for activation of Windows license.
  - DHCP traffic.
- FL collects the original outbound traffic and limited inbound traffic of the ENI on a CVM.
Assume you create a flow log for the ENI on a CVM:
 - When the CVM accesses the public network through a cloud load balancer, the “1” traffic will be collected for the outbound direction and the “2” traffic will be collected for the inbound direction.
 - When the CVM accesses the public network through a NAT Gateway, the “3” traffic will be collected for the outbound direction and the “4” traffic will be collected for the inbound direction.
