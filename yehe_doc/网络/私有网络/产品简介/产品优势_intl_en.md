### Network Customization
VPC provides you with robust network management capabilities. You can customize IP ranges and create subnets as in a traditional network, while flexibly configuring route tables and routing policies to deploy your cloud services.
Tencent Cloud VPC also provides network topologies to help you visualize and plan the network.

### Scalability
You can create different subnets in one or more VPCs to deploy your businesses in a scalable VPC environment. You can also connect the VPC with local IDCs, other VPCs, and classic networks to expand the network architecture as needed.

### Different Access Modes
VPC provides different access modes to meet the needs for cloud communications:
- Access the Internet: you can access the Internet through a public IP, EIP, NAT Gateway, CLB, etc.
- Access other VPC instances: you can access other VPC instances through CCN, peering connection, etc.
- Access local IDCs: you can access local IDCs through VPN connection, Direct Connect, and CCN.
- Access classic networks: you can access businesses deployed in a classic network through Classiclink.

### Security and Reliability
VPC uses the tunneling technology to build virtual networks on physical networks, and the Overlay technology to achieve private network isolation between VPC instances. It provides you with independent, isolated, and secure cloud networks.
For CVMs within a VPC, we also provide you with access controls at different levels, such as security groups and network ACLs.

### Ease of Use
You can create and manage VPC instances easily and quickly through the console, APIs, etc. The productized network features and different troubleshooting methods help reduce your OPS costs.
