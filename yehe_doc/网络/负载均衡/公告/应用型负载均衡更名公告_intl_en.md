Dear Tencent Cloud User,
For a better product experience, we are going to rename the instance type "Application Load Balancer" to "Cloud Load Balancer (CLB)".

| Original Name | New Name | Instance Type Description |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Application Load Balancer | Cloud Load Balancer | A major instance type which covers all features of Classic CLB <li>TCP/UDP/HTTP/HTTPS protocols are supported </li><li>Flexible forwarding capabilities based on domain name and URL path are provided</li> |
| Classic CLB | Classic CLB | Classic CLB <li>configuration is simple</li><li>Private network CLB does not support HTTP/HTTPS protocols</li> |

For detailed feature comparisons between the two instance types, please see [CLB Comparison](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/8847).

>
1. The name change does not affect CLB configuration, billing, or other rules. The original name will be specified in parentheses within two months after name change, and only the new name will be used after that.
2. We apologize for any inconvenience caused. If you have any questions, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category). Thank you for your support.

Sincerely,
Tencent Cloud Team
