## Overview
A **region** is an area where a Tencent Cloud managed data center is deployed. COS data is stored in buckets in these regions. You can use COS to store your data in multiple regions. In general, we recommend you create buckets in the region closest to the location where your business is conducted so as to reduce latency and costs and meet compliance requirements.

For example, if your business is distributed in South China, creating buckets in the Guangzhou region can further accelerate object uploads and downloads.

The **default domain name** refers to the default domain name of a COS bucket which is automatically generated by the system based on the bucket name and region when the bucket is created. It varies by region.


>? After a bucket is created, the corresponding default domain name will be generated, which can be viewed in **Basic Configuration** of the bucket in the [COS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5).

### Sample

Suppose you log in to the COS Console with your root account (APPID: 1250000000) and create a bucket named **examplebucket** in the **Guangzhou** region, then the default domain name of the bucket is as follows:
```shell
examplebucket-1250000000.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com
```

>?
>- `examplebucket-1250000000` means that the bucket is owned by the user with `APPID` 1250000000. `APPID` is the account you get after you successfully register in Tencent Cloud. It is automatically assigned by the system as a unique permanent ID, which can be viewed in [Account Information](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/developer).
- `cos` means Cloud Object Storage (COS).
- `ap-guangzhou` is the abbreviation of the bucket region.
- `myqcloud.com` is a fixed Tencent Cloud domain name.

After the bucket is created, upload an image file `picture.jpg` to the bucket, and the access address of the image is as follows:
```shell
examplebucket-1250000000.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/picture.jpg
```

>?If you set the access permission of the image to **public read/private write**, you can paste its access address into a browser to open it and view its details.



## Private Network and Public Network Access

The access domain names of COS use intelligent domain name resolution, so that your requests to COS can be routed through the optimal linkage in case of cross-ISP access.

If you deploy a service in Tencent Cloud to access COS, intra-region access requests will be automatically directed to a private network address. Currently cross-region requests do not support private network access and will be resolved to a public network address by default.

For more information on private network and public network access, please see [Creating Request Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30613).
