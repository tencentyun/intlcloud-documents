## Feature Overview
CI uses the **imageMogr2** API to rotate an image by a specified angle or automatically.

An image can be processed:

- During download
- During upload
- In the cloud

## Restrictions

- Format: Currently, JPG, BMP, GIF, PNG, and WebP images can be processed, and HEIF images can be decoded and processed.
- Size: The input image cannot be larger than 32 MB, with its width and height not exceeding 30,000 pixels respectively, and the total number of pixels not exceeding 250 million. The width and height of the output image cannot exceed 9,999 pixels respectively. For an animated input image, the total number of pixels (width * height * number of frames) cannot exceed 250 million.
- Frames (for animated images): For GIF images, the number of frames cannot exceed 300.


## API Format

#### 1. Processing during download

```plaintext
GET /<ObjectKey>?imageMogr2/rotate/<rotateDegree>
			   /auto-orient HTTP/1.1
Host: <BucketName-APPID>.cos.<Region>.myqcloud.com
Date: <GMT Date>
Authorization: <Auth String>
```

>! Spaces and line breaks above are for readability only and can be ignored.

#### 2. Processing during upload

```plaintext
PUT /<ObjectKey> HTTP/1.1
Host: <BucketName-APPID>.cos.<Region>.myqcloud.com
Date: GMT Date
Authorization: Auth String
Pic-Operations: 
{
  "is_pic_info": 1,
  "rules": [{
      "fileid": "exampleobject",
      "rule": "imageMogr2/rotate/<rotateDegree>
					   /auto-orient"
  }]
}
```

>? `Pic-Operations` is a JSON string. Its parameters are as described in [Persistent Image Processing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/33695).
>

#### 3. Processing in-cloud data

```plaintext
POST /<ObjectKey>?image_process HTTP/1.1
Host: <BucketName-APPID>.cos.<Region>.myqcloud.com
Date: GMT Date
Content-length: Size
Authorization: Auth String
Pic-Operations: 
{
  "is_pic_info": 1,
  "rules": [{
      "fileid": "exampleobject",
      "rule": "imageMogr2/rotate/<rotateDegree>
					   /auto-orient"
  }]
}
```


>? 
> - Authorization: Auth String (for more information, see [Request Signature](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7778)).
> - When this feature is used by a sub-account, relevant permissions must be granted. For more information, see [Authorization Granularity Details](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/49896).

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ObjectKey  | Object name, such as `folder/sample.jpg`.                           | 
| /rotate/&lt;rotateDegree> | Rotates an image clockwise by a specified angle. The value can be 0−360. By default, the image is not rotated. |
| /auto-orient              | Rotates an image automatically according to its EXIF data.         |
| /flip/&lt;flip&gt;            | Flips an image. Valid values: `vertical`, `horizontal`. |
| /ignore-error/1 | If this parameter is carried and the image fails to be processed because the image is too large or a parameter value exceeds the limit, the input image will be returned with no error reported. |

## Samples

>? **Processing during download** is used as an example here, which does not store the output image in a bucket. If you need to store the output image, see [Persistent Image Processing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/33695) and use the **processing during upload** or **processing in-cloud data** feature.

#### Sample 1: Rotating an image by a specified angle
This example rotates an image clockwise by 90 degrees:

```plaintext
http://examples-1251000004.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/sample.jpeg?imageMogr2/rotate/90
```

Output image:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/2d47c4f47b8f9c8eca85a3590a106e14.jpeg)

#### Sample 2: Rotating an image by a specified angle with a signature carried

This example processes the image in the same way as in the example above, except that a signature is carried. The signature is concatenated with other processing parameters by an ampersand (&).

```plaintext
http://examples-1251000004.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/sample.jpeg?q-sign-algorithm=<signature>&imageMogr2/rotate/90
```

>? You can get the value of `<signature>` as instructed in [Request Signature](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7778).

## Notes

To prevent unauthorized users from accessing or downloading the input image by using a URL that does not contain any processing parameter, you can add the processing parameters to the request signature, making the processing parameters the key of the parameter with the value left empty. The following is a simple sample for your reference (it might have expired or become inaccessible). For more information, see [Upload via Pre-Signed URL](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/14114).
