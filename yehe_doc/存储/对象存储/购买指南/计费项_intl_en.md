Billable items in COS include [storage usage](#jf1), [requests](#jf2), [data retrievals](#jf3), [traffic](#jf4), and [management features](#jf5). This document describes each billable item in detail. After learning about them and the [Product Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6239), you will be able to better estimate your COS fees.


> ?COS offers several object storage classes for different access frequencies: STANDARD, STANDARD_IA, and ARCHIVE. For more information, see [Storage Classes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30925).

## Storage Usage Fees

| Billable Item   | Applicable Storage Class       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                               | Definition                                                   | Billing Description                                                     |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Storage usage | STANDARD<br>STANDARD_IA<br>ARCHIVE | Storage usage is the actual storage space consumed by your data. It is billed based on the size of actual storage used.| <li>Monthly billing cycle<br><li>Storage usage fees = storage usage unit price * monthly storage usage<br><li>Monthly storage usage = sum of "daily storage usage" in the month / number of days in the month<br><li>Daily storage usage = sum of "5-minute storage usage" / 288 (number of statistical points) |



#### Billing restrictions

1. STANDARD_IA storage class: if the storage duration is less than 30 days, it will be calculated as 30 days. If a single file stored is less than 64 KB, it will be calculated as 64 KB; otherwise, it will be calculated as the actual size.
2. ARCHIVE storage class: this storage class is available in Public Cloud regions only. If the storage duration is less than 90 days, it will be calculated as 90 days. If a single file stored is less than 64 KB, it will be calculated as 64 KB; otherwise, it will be calculated as the actual size.
3. If you upload an object to STANDARD_IA or ARCHIVE storage class with versioning not enabled, COS will delete the existing objects (if any) of the **same name**. In this case, storage fees will still be incurred for the deleted objects.

## Request Fees

Request fees include the fees incurred by the **user requests** and the **backend requests** generated by feature configuration.

- User requests: you can perform upload, download, query, deletion and other data-related operations via API, SDK, console or related tool programs by sending request instructions to Tencent COS.
- Backend requests: include requests to transition objects, delete expired STANDARD copies restored from ARCHIVE, read/write data for cross-region replication, and deliver inventory reports.

| Billable Item   | Applicable Storage Class       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                               | Definition                                                   | Billing Description                                                     |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|Number of requests  | STANDARD<br>STANDARD_IA<br>ARCHIVE  | Calculated based on the number of requests sent  |  <li>Monthly billing cycle<br><li>If the accumulated number of requests is below 10,000, it will be calculated as 10,000 requests<br><li>Request fees = unit price per 10,000 requests * monthly accumulated number of requests / 10,000 (rounded down) |

#### Billing restrictions

1. Both successful and failed requests are billable.
2. 10,000 requests serve as the smallest counting unit for request fees; therefore, if the number of monthly accumulated requests is below 10,000 it will be calculated as 10,000 requests, no matter whether a request succeeds or fails.
3. ARCHIVE storage class data cannot be read or downloaded. The data must first be restored to STANDARD storage class and read there. Therefore, such requests are counted as STANDARD requests.

## Data Retrieval Fees



| Billable Item | Applicable Storage Class | Definition | Billing Description |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data retrieved | STANDARD_IA<br />ARCHIVE | Calculated based on the amount of data retrieved | <li>Monthly billing cycle<br /><li>Data retrieval fees = unit price per GB * monthly amount of data retrieved |

#### Billing restrictions

**STANDARD_IA** and **ARCHIVE** storage classes are designed to store cold data. To read or download data from STANDARD_IA, COS need to retrieve it first. Archived data cannot be read or downloaded until it is restored (unfrozen) to STANDARD storage class.

## Traffic Fees

Traffic fees are calculated based on the accumulated traffic generated by storage data reads.

</table>

#### Billing restrictions

1. ARCHIVE storage class data cannot be read or downloaded. The data must first be restored to STANDARD storage class and read there. Therefore, traffic from these requests are counted in the STANDARD storage class.
2. **Public network downstream traffic** is generated when the COS origin server returns data to a third-party CDN node during origin-pull.
3. Tencent Cloud CDN origin-pull traffic is generated by browsing or downloading COS data on the client through **a Tencent Cloud CDN acceleration domain name** after CDN acceleration is enabled.

> ?
> - Tencent Cloud products within the same region access each other over the private network by default and no traffic fees will be incurred. For more information on how to identify private network access, please see [COS Access via Private Network and Public Network](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30613?lang=en&pg=#cos-access-via-private-network-and-public-network).
> - Public network downstream traffic is generated by downloading objects through **object links** and browsing objects through **static website access node**. 
> - CDN origin-pull traffic is generated by browsing or downloading COS data from the client through **CDN acceleration domain name** after CDN acceleration is enabled.
> - Cross-region replication traffic is generated by the replication of data in a bucket in one region to another bucket in another region through replication APIs or cross-region replication feature is cross-region replication traffic.

#### Traffic trends

The figure below shows how traffic fees are incurred as data flows from COS to end user with CDN acceleration domain name enabled and disabled, respectively.

## Management Feature Fees

Management feature fees are calculated based on the use of enabled management features, such as inventory and COS select.
