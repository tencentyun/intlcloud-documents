## How much do certification exams cost?

The cost of each certification exam depends on its level of difficulty. The Practitioner exam is priced at $100 USD and the Associate-level exams are priced at $150 USD.

## How long do I have to complete a certification exam?

The length of each Tencent Cloud certification exam depends on its level of difficulty. The Practitioner exam and the Associate-level exams are allotted 90 minutes, while the Pro-level exams are allotted 120 minutes.

## Are online proctored certification exams open-book?

No, Tencent Cloud certification exams are not open-book, which means that you cannot use any prepared or outside materials during your exam. Your testing space must be free of all items (including but not limited to external monitors, papers, writing instruments, note-taking materials, wearable and non-wearable smart electronic devices, food, and water) except for your computer or laptop. Using any unauthorized materials during the exam will cause your exam session to be terminated, your exam result to be invalidated, and your exam fee to be forfeited.

## What is the retake policy for online proctored exams?

After failing a certification exam the first time, the candidate must wait 14 days to retake the exam. After failing a certification exam the second time, the candidate must wait 60 days to retake the exam. After failing a certification exam the third time, the candidate must wait 1 year to retake the exam. This retake policy applies to all certification exam types. Circumventing this retake policy by registering for an exam using a different name or any other methods is a violation of Tencent Cloud’s Exam Security Agreement and will result in a denied or revoked certification.

## How long will it take to complete an online proctored exam?

After you start a Tencent Cloud certification exam, an online proctor will verify your identity, ensure the testing environment is secured, and then launch the exam, which will take about 5-8 minutes. Once the exam is launched, you will have 90-120 minutes to complete the exam, depending on its level of difficulty. For the specific length of time allotted to each exam, please refer to the “How long do I have to complete a certification exam?” question above.

## Can I take breaks during my exam?

No breaks are allowed during your exam. Please be prepared to take the exam in one sitting. Taking any break during the exam will cause your exam session to be terminated, your exam result to be invalidated, and your exam fee to be forfeited.

## What happens if I am early/late for my scheduled exam?

On the day of the exam, you may launch the test session up to 10 minutes before and 20 minutes after the scheduled exam start time. If you do not launch your exam during that period of time, your exam session will be terminated automatically and your exam fee will be forfeited. You will need to re-register and pay for the exam again.

## I will be unable to take the exam on the scheduled date and time. How can I reschedule?

You can reschedule your exam up to 24 hours before your scheduled exam start time by logging in to your [Tencent Cloud Webassessor](https://www.webassessor.com/tencent) account. If you reschedule your exam less than 24 hours before your scheduled exam start time, you will be charged a late rescheduling fee. If you cancel your exam less than 24 hours before your exam time, you will be charged a late cancellation fee.

## I encountered technical difficulties while taking the online proctored exam. Can I re-register and reschedule my exam?

Tencent Cloud or Kryterion is not responsible for any unsuccessful exam session due to poor internet connectivity, low bandwidth at the test taker’s site or inability to meet the system and technical requirements prior to the exam launch. A Kryterion technician will attempt to restart your exam session, but if the session cannot be immediately restarted and you have been exposed to exam content, the test attempt will count and the retake policy will apply. If you wish to re-register, please do so in Webassessor after the cool off period has ended. Payment is required each time you take an exam.

## I am unable to complete my session due to technical difficulties. Who do I contact?

Please [chat](https://kryterion.force.com/support/s/topic/0TO1W000000I5h3WAC/online-proctoring?language=en_US) with or [email](https://kryterion.force.com/support/s/contactsupport?language=en_US) Kryterion’s technical support team.

## Will the online proctor see my surroundings during the exam?

As part of the online proctoring of each exam, Tencent Cloud or its authorized agent may record and/or watch a live webcast of you during your exam session (including your immediate surroundings), communicate with you, and record your exam to ensure proper security. For more details, please review the Tencent Cloud’s Exam Security Agreement that will be displayed on your screen before you launch an exam on Kryterion.
