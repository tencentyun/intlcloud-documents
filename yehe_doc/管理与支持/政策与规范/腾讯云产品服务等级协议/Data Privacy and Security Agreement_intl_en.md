### TECHNICAL AND ORGANISATIONAL SECURITY MEASURES

We have implemented a comprehensive privacy and security programme for the purpose of protecting your content. **This program includes the following**:

**Data security.** We have designed and implemented the following measures to protect customer’s data against unauthorized access:

standards for data categorisation and classification;

a set of authentication and access control capabilities at the physical, network, system and application levels; and

a mechanism for detecting big data-based abnormal behaviour.

**Network security.** We implement stringent rules on internal network isolation to achieve access control and border protection for internal networks (including office networks, development networks, testing networks and production networks) by way of physical and logical isolation.

**Physical and environmental security.** Stringent infrastructure and environment access controls have been implemented for Tencent Cloud’s data centers based on relevant regional security requirements. An access control matrix is established, based on the types of data center personnel and their respective access privileges, to ensure effective management and control of access and operations by data center personnel.

**Incident management.**  We operate active and real-time service monitoring, combined with a rapid response and handling mechanism, that enables prompt detection and handling of security incidents.

**Compliance with standards.** We comply with the standards  listed in our Compliance Center page, and as updated from time to time.
