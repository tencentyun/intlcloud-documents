>! All the dates and time for settlements and transactions under your Tencent Cloud account are based on Beijing Time (UTC + 08:00).

There are three ways to make a repayment for your Tencent Cloud post-paid account. To check the repayment records, go to **Billing Center** > **[Transactions](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/expense/transactions)**.

- **Automatic repayment of the unpaid bill amount**
 Tencent Cloud services are billed based on your billing cycle. The system will automatically deduct the unpaid bill amount from your default payment account bound with your Tencent Cloud post-paid account on the due date (10th of each month).

  Suppose your credit limit is 30 USD and your billing cycle is one month. You spent 20 USD on Tencent Cloud services in August, during which your available credit was deducted to 10 USD. The system will automatically deduct 20 USD on September 10, and after that your available credit will be restored to 30 USD.

- **Automatic repayment will be made when the available credit is less than 0 USD (credit control)**
Suppose a sum of cost is newly incurred before the due date (10th of each month). If the available credit in your account is equal to 0 USD or less than the newly incurred cost. The system will automatically deduct the sum of the outstanding amount plus the newly incurred cost.

  Take two accounts for example to see how the above two kinds of repayments are made.

   For account A, the bill amount of August is 30 USD and the due date is September 10. If the available credit is always no less than 0 USD before September 10, no automatic repayment will be made. The unpaid bill amount of USD 30 will be deducted on September 10.

   For account B, the credit limit is 30 USD, the bill amount for August is 25 USD and its due date is September 10th. At 9:00 on September 5, the available credit is 0 USD and the outstanding amount is 30 USD. Suppose a Tencent Cloud service that costs 10 USD is purchased at this time point. Automatic repayment of 40 USD will be made as the available credit is less than 0 USD (credit control) and the deduction amount equals to the outstanding amount plus the newly incurred cost. As the outstanding amount has already been paid on September 5, no automatic repayment will be made on September 10.

- **Self-service repayment via credit card or bank transfer**
If your account is in arrears, you can make a payment on the Billing Center manually to avoid service suspension:

  A. Log in to Tencent Cloud Billing Center, click **Pay Now** on the **Account Info** page to pay off the outstanding amount if there is enough surplus amount in your account. You cannot make a payment this way if the outstanding amount is not less than 0 USD.

  B. You can also go to the **Payment** page to make a payment via credit card or bank transfer. If the payment amount is larger than the current outstanding amount, the surplus amount will be counted as available credit and cannot be withdrawn later on.
