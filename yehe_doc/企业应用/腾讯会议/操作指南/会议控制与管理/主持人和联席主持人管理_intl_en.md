## Feature Overview
A co-host can help the host manage attendees and their permissions such as renaming and muting/unmuting to mitigate the pressure of the host and improve the meeting efficiency.

## Prerequisites
- **Logged-in user:** Free or Enterprise Edition user.
- **Logged-in device:** Windows, macOS, iOS, or Android.

## Notes
1. Attendees not logged in cannot be made host.
 - Free Edition: you can set one co-host at most. If you have set a co-host, the Make Co-host option won't be displayed when you try to set another in attendees list.
 - Enterprise Edition: you can set up to 10 co-hosts. If the current meeting already has 10 co-hosts and the meeting creator enters the meeting, the creator can become the 11th co-host, but no more co-hosts can be set.
2. A meeting can have only one host, and only the host can make other attendees co-hosts.
3. A co-host has fewer permissions than a host. Their main difference is that the host can assign roles to other attendees, while the co-host cannot.
4. The co-host can be revoked by the host but cannot be proactively given up by the co-host.
5. If there is a co-host in the meeting and the host leaves the meeting without passing host controls, the co-host will automatically become the host. If there are multiple co-hosts, the earliest one getting the co-host controls will automatically become the host.
6. When the meeting creator enters or re-enters the meeting, the creator will become a co-host but can reclaim the host controls without the consent of the current host. After the host controls are reclaimed, the original host will become an attendee.
7. When a co-host who is not the meeting creator re-enters a meeting, the co-host will become an attendee.
8. If the meeting host and co-hosts perform conflicting or repeated operations on the same feature, the last operation that is performed will take effect.
9. Role changes do not affect the current mic and camera status.
