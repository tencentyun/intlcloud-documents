## Feature Overview
A personal meeting ID is your dedicated fixed meeting ID, through which you can start a meeting directly.

## Prerequisites
- **Logged-in user:** Free or Enterprise Edition user.
- **Logged-in device:** Windows, macOS, iOS, or Android.
- **Version:** v1.5.0 or later.

## Notes
- A personal meeting can be created only as a directly started meeting instead of a scheduled meeting.
- On the **Settings** page of Use Personal Meeting ID, you can set the meeting password, enable the waiting room, allow attendees to join the meeting before the host (enabled by default), and mute attendees when they join the meeting. To start a meeting using your personal meeting ID, you can click **Start** and select **Use Personal Meeting ID**. To start a meeting with random meeting ID, you can deselect **Use Personal Meeting ID**.
- Currently, meetings started through a personal meeting ID don't support the meeting file feature.
