Due to the policy adjustments of CAs and certificate agents, from January 1, 2018, you can apply for 20 free TrustAsia DV SSL certificates at most for one primary domain (the second-level domain and its subdomains, such as `tencent.com`, `ssl.tencent.com`, and `ssl.ssl.tencent.com`, belong to the same primary domain). Issued certificates will continue to be valid within their validity periods. If your business is affected by the adjustments, we recommend you purchase wildcard SSL certificates.
