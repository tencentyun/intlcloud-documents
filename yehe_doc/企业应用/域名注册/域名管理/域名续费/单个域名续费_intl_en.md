## Common Issues After Renewal
If you renew your domain during the redemption period, its DNS may have been paused by the registrar, making your website inaccessible.
- DNS of domains resolved by DNSPod will be recovered within 72 hours after successful renewal.
- DNS of domains not resolved by DNSPod will be recovered within 48–72 hours after successful renewal.
