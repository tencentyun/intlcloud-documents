### Starting up an instance via an API
Use the [StartInstances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/33236) API to start up an instance.

## Subsequent Operations
Once the instance starts up, you can perform the following operations:
- **Logging in to the instance**: depending on the instance type, log in to the [Linux instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5436) or the [Windows instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5435).
- **[Initializing cloud disks](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31596)**: initialize the cloud disks mounted to the instance by formatting, partitioning, and creating a file system.
