>!The free tier for API Gateway was adjusted at 23:59:59 on October 12, 2020. After this adjustment, a 12-month free usage period has become available for accounts. During this period, users can enjoy 1 million calls and 1 GB of public network outbound traffic free of charge each month. The free tier is issued in the form of a resource pack and does not have to be claimed. For users who are using API Gateway, the free tier will be recalculated and complete free tier resource packs will be issued to them.

New API Gateway users are eligible for the following limited-time free tier:

| Billable Item | Free Tier | Validity Period |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Number of calls | The first 1 million calls in each calendar month | 12 calendar months in the first year after API Gateway is activated |
| Public network outbound traffic | The first 1 GB of public network outbound traffic in each calendar month | 12 calendar months in the first year after API Gateway is activated |

### Effective scope
The free tier is issued in the form of a resource pack and deducts account-level usage.
 
### Viewing the resource pack usage
1. Log in to the [API Gateway console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/apigateway).
2. In the left sidebar, click **Resource Pack** to access the resource pack list page.
3. View the usage of resource packs whose sources are free tier.

### Calculating the validity period
After the service is activated, the first 1 million calls in each calendar month in the first year (including the month when the service is activated) are free of charge.
For example, if you activate API Gateway at 17:13:14 on November 10, 2019, then the 1 million free calls will be valid from November. Unused calls in the free tier will not accumulate to the next month. Therefore, the monthly free tier will be reset at 00:00:00 on December 1, 2019. The free tier will become unavailable after 23:59:59 on November 10, 2020.
