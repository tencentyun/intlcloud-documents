**If your backend business and API Gateway are in different regions, or the backend business is not in Tencent Cloud, the fees generated by the traffic from API Gateway to your backend business will be billed additionally according to [Traffic Fees](#llfy).**

## Billing Example
Billing for the Guangzhou region is as shown in the following example:
The backend business is in a different region from API Gateway and receives five million API calls accumulatively in a month, each of which returns a response of about 3 KB in size, and the size of each request of data forwarded from API Gateway to the backend business is 1 KB.
- API Gateway call fees = 5 million * 0.0089 USD/10,000 calls = 4.45 USD
- Total data transfer volume = 5 million * 3 KB = 15 million KB = 14.3 GB
- Total additional data transfer volume = 5 million * 1 KB = 5 million KB = 4.77 GB
- Total data transfer fees = 14.3 GB * 0.12 USD/GB + 4.77 GB * 0.12 USD/GB = 2.29 USD
- Total fees = 4.45 USD + 2.29 USD = 6.74 USD
