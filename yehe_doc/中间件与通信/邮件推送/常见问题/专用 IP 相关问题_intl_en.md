### What is a dedicated IP?
A dedicated IP is an IP specially assigned to you by Tencent Cloud for sending emails. Generally, it either has never been used to send emails or has a good reputation in the past. This ensures that it will not be marked as a spam IP by anti-spam organizations.

### Do I have to purchase a dedicated IP to use SES?
No, but if you need to send a larger number of emails, contact your sales rep to apply for a dedicated IP.
