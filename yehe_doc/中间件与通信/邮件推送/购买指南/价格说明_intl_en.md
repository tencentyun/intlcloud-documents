- Resource packages are prepaid and take effect after purchase. 
- The validity period of each resource package is calculated separately, and any unused traffic after package expiration cannot be unsubscribed or refunded. If your account is used to send non-compliant content, we will block your account, and your prepaid resources cannot be refunded.
- Email usage will be deducted first from valid resource packages in order of expiration time.
- After all resource package are used up, the service can still be used and will become pay-as-you-go.


## Pay-as-You-Go
You will be charged according to your actual usage at the price of 0.00028 USD/email. 
## Free Tier
Each Tencent Cloud account is entitled to a free tier of 1,000 emails. You will be billed for emails sent beyond the free tier.
## Rules for Service Suspension
SES uses a daily pay-as-you-go billing cycle. In other words, Tencent Cloud will generate a bill based on your daily usage and deduct the corresponding amount from your account balance. If your account balance is insufficient and the deduction fails, Tencent Cloud will suspend the service, in which case you will not be able to use SES. Service will automatically resume once you top up your account balance.
