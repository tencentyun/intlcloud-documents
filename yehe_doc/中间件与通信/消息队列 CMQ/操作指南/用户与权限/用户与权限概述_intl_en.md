In Tencent Cloud CMQ, you can use **users and permissions** to manage and control permissions and set permissions in **policy management** for specified **users** or **user groups** at the level of API or API set.

This document describes the dimensions of CMQ permission settings and how to set permissions.

## 1. Policy

Tencent Cloud uses **policies** to control relevant permissions of users or user groups. You can create an appropriate policy first and then associate it with specified users or user groups.

## 2. User and User Group
