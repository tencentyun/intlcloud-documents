## Overview

CKafka allows you to monitor the resources created under your account, such as instances, topics, and consumer groups, so that you can keep track of the status of your resources in real time and troubleshoot possible issues to ensure stable business operations.

This document describes how to view monitoring metrics and their descriptions in the CKafka console.

## Directions

1. Log in to the [CKafka console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ckafka).
2. In the instance list, click the **ID/Name** of the target instance to enter the instance details page.
3. At the top of the instance details page, Click **Monitor**, select resource tags, and set the time range to view the monitoring data about the instance.
   - You can click ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/9ba57bbd3b8ef3efc4f687d63d27a46d.png) to view the historical monitoring data.
   - You can click ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/34bdbdbdabb7b5720bf17d78c636a4ad.png) to refresh and get the latest monitoring data.
   - You can click ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/8f2bf7f4df9ddd959f0ecb69fdda8e4c.png) to copy the chart to a dashboard. For more information on dashboard, see [What Is a Dashboard?](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/38461).
   - You can select ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/af20129df7be46f33ab7d3598f6e9213.png) to display the legend information on the chart.

### Monitoring information display

### Descriptions of metrics

The following lists the CKafka monitoring metrics and their description. Based on user feedback and statistics, we recommend you configure monitoring and alarming policies for metrics marked with the word **recommended**. Configure policies properly as needed.

| Number of connections (Count) **(recommended)** | Number of connections between clients and servers in the cluster. |
| Maximum production traffic in instance (MB) **(recommended)** | Instance message production bandwidth peak (excluding bandwidth of replica production).               |
| Maximum consumption traffic in instance (MB) **(recommended)** | Instance message consumption bandwidth peak (consumption does not involve replicas).                 |
| Instance consumption throttling occurrences (Count)                    | Number of instance consumption throttling occurrences. |
| Instance production throttling occurrences (Count)              | Number of instance production throttling occurrences.                                           |
| Instance message production bandwidth peak (MB)         | Instance message production bandwidth peak (including bandwidth of replica production).                 |
| Messages stored in instance (Count)          | Total number of stored messages in the instance (excluding those produced by replicas), which is the latest value in the selected time period. |
| Instance consumption traffic (MB)                     | Consumption traffic of the instance (excluding traffic generated by replicas), which is the total traffic in the selected time period. |
| Messages produced in instance (Count)              | Number of messages produced in the instance, which is the total number of messages in the selected time period.             |
| Instance production traffic (MB) | Production traffic of the instance (excluding traffic generated by replicas), which is the total traffic in the selected time period. |
