## Feature Overview
This API is used by the app admin to create groups.

## API Calling Description
### Applicable group types

| Group Type ID | RESTful API Support |
|-----------|------------|
| Private | Yes. Same as work groups (Work) in the new version. |
| Public | Yes |
| ChatRoom | Yes. Same as meeting groups (Meeting) in the new version. |
| AVChatRoom | Yes. To use an audio-video group (AVChatroom), users (including the group owner) must use the SDK to request to join the group. |
| Community | Yes |


These are the preset group types in Chat. For more information, see [Group System](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529).

>!
>- If the group type is specified as audio-video group (AVChatRoom):
>  - When creating a group of this type, the group creator cannot add users to the group. If a group member is specified during the group creation, error 10007 will be returned. Users can only request to join this type of group. If a group owner is specified, the group owner must use the SDK API to join the group every time he or she uses the group.
>- If the group type is specified as a type other than an audio-video group (AVChatRoom):
>  - If neither a group owner nor a group member list is specified when the request is sent, the number of groups that can be created is unrestricted.
>  - If a group owner or group member list is specified when the request is sent, the specified group owner or group members are automatically added to the group.
>- If the total number of groups in the app exceeds 100,000, certain fees will be charged. For more information, see [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350).
>- The number of groups that a user can join at the same time is limited. If the number is reached, joining or creating a group will fail. For more information, see [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350).

## Error Codes

The returned HTTP status code for this API is always 200 unless a network error (such as error 502) occurs. The specific error code and details can be found in the response fields `ErrorCode` and `ErrorInfo` respectively.
For public error codes (60000 to 79999), see [Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34348).
The following table describes the error codes specific to this API:

| Error Code | Description |
|---------|---------|
| 10002 | Internal server error. Try again. |
| 10003| Invalid request command word. |
| 10004 | Invalid parameter. Check the error description and fix the issue. |
| 10005 | The number of members imported in the request packet exceeds 100. Reduce the number of members imported in the `MemberList` parameter. |
| 10006 | The operation exceeds the frequency limit. Please reduce the call frequency. This error is usually caused by too much net group increase in a single day or too frequent calls to obtain all groups in the app. |
| 10007 | Insufficient operation permission. Check the request parameters based on the error information. For example, the specified group type does not allow adding members but `MemberList` was specified in the request. |
| 10008 | The request is invalid, probably because verification of the signing information in the request failed. Please try again or [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category?level1_id=29&level2_id=40&source=0&data_title=%E4%BA%91%E9%80%9A%E4%BF%A1%20%20IM&step=1). |
| 10016 | The app backend rejected this operation through a webhook. Check the returned value of your wehook "Before a group is created". |
| 10021 | The group ID has already been used by another user. Select another group ID. |
|10025 | You have already used this group ID. Disband the existing group first or select another group ID. |
| 10036 | The number of audio-video groups (AVChatRoom) created exceeds the limit. Delete some of the groups or purchase an upgrade by referring to [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350). |
| 10037 | The request specifies Owner_Account, but the number of groups that the group owner has created or joined exceeds the limit. The group owner needs to leave some groups first or refer to [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350) to purchase an upgrade. |
| 10038 | The number of members imported in the request packet exceeds the limit. Reduce the number of members imported in the `MemberList` parameter or purchase an upgrade by referring to [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350). |
|10058| You are now using the Free Edition, and the free quota of 100 groups is exceeded. To create more groups, you need to purchase a package. |
