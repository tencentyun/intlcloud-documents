## Features
- This API is used to send one-to-one messages to multiple users (up to 500) at a time.
- Compared with the API for sending one-to-one messages to one user, this API is more suitable for time-sensitive messages, such as marketing messages and system notifications.
- If you don’t want to count messages as unread or store them, you can set `MsgLifeTime` to `0`. This will make message delivery faster.
- When the admin specifies an account to send a message to multiple target accounts, the sender displayed to the recipients is not the admin, but the account specified by the admin.
- This API does not trigger callback requests.
- This API does not check whether the sender and the recipients are friends or blocklisted by either party or whether the recipients are muted.
- This API does not check whether the recipient has muted notifications for messages from the sender by default. If needed, enter `WithMuteNotifications` in the `SendMsgControl` parameter.
- For one-to-one messages, the `MsgSeq` field is specified by the user when the message is sent. Its value can be repeated. It is not generated by the backend and not globally unique. For group chat messages, the value of the `MsgSeq` field is generated by the backend, and each group maintains its respective `MsgSeq` which increases strictly from 1. For one-to-one messages, the historical messages of the same conversation are sorted by timestamp first, and then the historical messages of the same second are sorted by `MsgSeq`.

>!When calling this API to batch send a message, you must specify whether to synchronize the message to the sender, which is the admin account or the account specified by the admin. Synchronization can be implemented via online terminals and roaming servers. This API provides the `SyncOtherMachine` parameter to determine whether to synchronize the message. For more information, please see **Sample request** below.

### Sample request
Here, we use sending a text message as an example. To send messages of other types, set `MsgBody` to the corresponding message type. For more information, see [Message Formats](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33527).

#### The admin sends a message to multiple target accounts.

>!If you do not want to synchronize the message to `From_Account`, set `SyncOtherMachine` to `2`.
>To synchronize the message to `From_Account`, set `SyncOtherMachine` to `1`.

```
{
    "SyncOtherMachine": 2, // Do not synchronize the message to the sender.
    "To_Account": [ // A list of target accounts
        "bonnie",
        "rong"
    ],
    "MsgSeq": 28360, // Sequence number of the message.

#### The admin specifies an account to send a message to multiple target accounts and sets the information of offline push.
`From_Account` is the sender specified by the admin. The sender displayed to the recipients is not the admin, but the account specified by the admin. In the following JSON request, dave sends a message to bonnie and rong. When bonnie and rong receive the message, the message sender displayed to them is dave.
>!If you do not want to synchronize the message to `From_Account`, set `SyncOtherMachine` to `2`.
>To synchronize the message to `From_Account`, set `SyncOtherMachine` to `1`.
