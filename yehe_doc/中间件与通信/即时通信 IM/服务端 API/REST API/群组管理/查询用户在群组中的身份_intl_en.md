## Feature Description
This API is used by the app admin to batch obtain the roles of users in a group.

## API Calling Description
### Applicable group types

| Group Type ID | Is this RESTful API Supported? |
|-----------|------------|
| Private | Yes. Same as Work (work group for friends) in the new version. |
| Public | Yes. |
| ChatRoom | Yes. Same as Meeting (temporary meeting group) in the new version. |
| AVChatRoom | No. |

These are the 4 built-in group types in IM. For detailed information, see the [Group System](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529).

>?AVChatRooms (livestreaming groups) do not support this API and a 10007 error will be returned if this operation is performed on this type of group. To achieve the same result, you can call the API for [obtaining profiles of group members](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/document/product/1047/34948).
