## Feature Description
This API is used by app admins to obtain the list of groups a certain user has joined. The information of work groups (Work) and livestreaming groups (AVChatRoom) that the user has joined but are not activated is not pulled by default.

## API Calling Description
### Applicable group types

| Group Type ID | Is this RESTful API Supported? |
|-----------|------------|
| Private | Yes. Same as Work (work group for friends) in the new version. The information work groups that the user has joined but are not activated is not returned by default. |
| Public | Yes. |
| ChatRoom | Yes. Same as Meeting (temporary meeting group) in the new version. |
| AVChatRoom | Yes. The information of AVChatRooms that the user has joined is not returned by default. |

These are the 4 built-in group types in IM. For detailed information, see the [Group System](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529).

### Maximum calling frequency

The maximum calling frequency is 200 calls per second.

### Sample request packet

- **Basic form**
The request in basic form is used to obtain the information about groups that a user has joined. The group information only contains the IDs of users in the group.
```
{
    "Member_Account": "leckie"
}
```
- **Pagination pull**
You can use the Limit and Offset fields to control the pagination mode:
 - Limit specifies the maximum number of groups in GroupIdList in the response packet, which cannot exceed 5,000.
 - Offset specifies the sequence number of the group in the entire group list, starting from which the information is read. Offset is 0 by default. If pagination is requested (the page number starts from 1), the Offset value of each page should be `(Page number – 1) × Number of groups displayed on each page`.
For example, assume that pagination is needed, and 20 groups are displayed on each page. The request parameter for the first page should be `{“Limit”: 20, “Offset”: 0}`, the request parameter for the second page should be `{“Limit”: 20, “Offset”: 20}`, and so on.

 The value of Limit or Offset does not affect TotalCount in the response packet.
```
{
    "Member_Account": "leckie",
    "Limit": 10, // Specifies the number of groups to be pulled. If this field is not specified, all groups will be pulled.
    "Offset": 0 // Specifies the sequence number of the group starting from which the information is pulled.
}
```
- **Specify the group type**
You can specify the type of groups to be pulled, for example, Public (social networking group for strangers), Private (work group for friends, same as Work in the new version), and ChatRoom (meeting group, same as Meeting in the new version). If AVChatRoom (livestreaming group) is specified, you may obtain an incomplete list of members.
```
{
    "Member_Account": "leckie",
    "GroupType": "Public" // Specifies the type of groups to be pulled. If this parameter is not specified, all types of groups will be pulled.
}
```
- **Pull the specified information**
To specify basic information fields to be pulled, set GroupBaseInfoFilter.
To specify the group member information in the group that needs to be pulled, set SelfInfoFilter. 
```
{
    "Member_Account": "leckie",
    "WithHugeGroups":1, // Supports pulling the information of AVChatRoom groups (livestreaming groups).
    "WithNoActiveGroups":1,// Supports pulling the information of Private (work group for friends, same as Work in the new version) groups that the user has joined but are not activated.
    "Limit": 10, // Specifies the number of groups to be pulled. If this field is not specified, all groups will be pulled.
    "Offset": 0, // Specifies the sequence number of the group starting from which the information is pulled.
    "ResponseFilter": {
        "GroupBaseInfoFilter": [ // Specifies basic information fields to be pulled.
            "Type",
            "Name",
            "Introduction",
            "Notification"
        ],
        "SelfInfoFilter": [ // Specifies your own information in the group.
            "Role", // Role in the group
            "JoinTime" // Time when the member joined the group
        ]
    }
}
```
- **ALL IN ONE**
```
{
  "Member_Account": "leckie",
  "WithHugeGroups":1, 
  "WithNoActiveGroups":1,
  "ResponseFilter": {
        "GroupBaseInfoFilter": [
            "Type",
            "Name",
            "Introduction",
            "Notification",
            "FaceUrl",
            "CreateTime",
            "Owner_Account",

            "LastMsgTime",
            "NextMsgSeq",
            "MemberNum",
            "MaxMemberNum",

## Error Codes
Unless a network error (such as error 502) occurs, the returned HTTP status code for this API is always 200. The specific error code and details can be found in the response packet fields such as `ErrorCode` and `ErrorInfo`.
For public error codes (60000 to 79999), see [Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34348).
The list below contains error codes specific to this API:

| Error Code | Description |
|---------|---------|
| 10002 | A system error occurred. Please try again or contact our technical support. |
| 10003 | The request command is invalid. Please try again or contact our technical support. |
