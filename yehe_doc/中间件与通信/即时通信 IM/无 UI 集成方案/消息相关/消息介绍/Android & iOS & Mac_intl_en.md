## Message Class
In the Tencent Cloud IM SDK, the message class is `V2TIMMessage` ([Android](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/classcom_1_1tencent_1_1imsdk_1_1v2_1_1V2TIMMessage.html) / [iOS and macOS](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/interfaceV2TIMMessage.html)), which will be frequently used for message sending and receiving.

The `V2TIMMessage` class defines the following content:

| Attribute                 | Definition                                                   | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| msgID                     | Message ID                                                   | It is empty when a message is created and is returned synchronously when `sendMessage` is called. |
| timestamp                 | Message timestamp                                            | The time a message is sent to the server, which can be used for message sorting |
| sender                    | `userID` of the message sender                               | It can be set by usersand must be the same as the `userID` passed in during login. |
| nickName                  | Nickname of the message sender                               | It can be set by users and modified by calling `setSelfInfo`. For more information, see [User Profile](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/48162). |
| friendRemark              | Remarks of the message sender's friend                       | It is used by the receiver. For example, if Alice sets Bob's remarks to `bob01`, when Bob sends a message to Alice, Alice will see that `friendRemark` in the message is `bob01`. It can be set by calling `setFriendInfo`. |

For example, if Alice changes her group name card to `doctorA` and sends a message to the group, other group members will receive the message where the `nameCard` field is `doctorA`. The receiver can prioritize this field as the username for display. `nameCard` can be set by calling `setGroupMemberInfo`. |
| faceURL                   | Profile photo of the message sender                          | It can be set by users and can be used to download the photo. |

| userID                    | User ID                                                      | `userID` is the ID of the receiver in a one-to-one message or `nil` in a group message. |

## Message Types

IM messages can be classified by message destination into two types: one-to-one messages (also called C2C messages) and group messages.

| Message Type       | API Keyword  | Description                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| One-to-one message | C2CMessage   | It is also called the C2C message. When sending a one-to-one message, you must specify the `UserID` of the receiver, and only the receiver can receive this message. |
| Group message      | GroupMessage | When sending a group message, you must specify the `groupID` of the target group, and all users in the group can receive this message. |

IM messages can also be classified by content into text messages, custom (signaling) messages, image messages, video messages, audio messages, file messages, location messages, and merged messages.

| Message Type     | API Keyword  | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Text message     | TextElem     | Ordinary text message                                        |
| Custom message   | CustomElem   | It is a section of binary buffer and often used to transfer custom signaling in your application. |
| Image message    | ImageElem    | When the SDK sends an original image, it automatically generates two images in different sizes. The three images are called the original image, large image, and thumbnail. |
| Video message    | VideoElem    | A video message contains a video file and a thumbnail.       |
| Audio message    | SoundElem    | It supports displaying a red dot before the playback of the audio message. |
| File message     | FileElem     | A file message cannot exceed 100 MB.                         |
| Location message | LocationElem | A location message contains three fields: location description, longitude, and latitude. |
| Merged message   | MergerElem   | It is suitable for merging and forwarding chat history. Up to 300 messages can be merged. |


## Message Storage Policy

IM messages can be classified by message storage policy into two types: online messages and non-online messages.
Online messages can be received only by online users and will not be pushed when they are offline. Non-online messages can be received by users whether they are online or not.

Online messages are delivered in real time and not stored on the server or in the SDK. Therefore, they cannot be pulled from historical messages after the device is changed or the application is uninstalled and reinstalled.

> ?
> 1. All messages in an audio-video group are online messages.
> 2. Messages pushed to all users are online messages.

Non-online messages are stored in the SDK and on the server. By default, they are stored on the roaming server for seven days. If you want a longer storage period, you need to purchase the value-added service. For more information on the service content and billing, see [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350).

These messages can be pulled from historical messages after the device is changed or the application is uninstalled and reinstalled.
