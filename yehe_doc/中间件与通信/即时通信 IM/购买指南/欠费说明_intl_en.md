If your Tencent Cloud account is past due for over 1 day after the bill was pushed to you, the service will be suspended. If your service is suspended for a long time, your resources will be repossessed and **cannot be recovered**.


## Service Suspension Policies



### Accounts with overdue payments
The postpaid bill for using related resources will be pushed to your account on the first to third day of the next month. At that point, your account is past due if your Tencent Cloud account does not have a sufficient balance to pay the bill or your balance is below zero. If your Tencent Cloud account is past due for over 1 day after the bill was pushed to you, the service will be suspended. You will not be able to continue using any Tencent Cloud services after the suspension.

## Resource Repossession
After the service suspension, your SDKAppID resources will be retained for 90 days (including the day on which the service was suspended). If you fail to top up your account in 90 days, your resources will be repossessed and **cannot be recovered**.
