## Creating Sub-user

A root account/admin user can create one or more sub-user accounts for team members and bind permission policies to them. The CAM authorization feature of TMS supports three creation methods: **quick creation, custom creation, and import from WeChat/WeCom**.

- Quick creation is easy and fast, but the permission policies that can be bound are relatively fixed.
- Custom creation is complex, but it supports batch creation and refined permission policy management.
- Import from WeChat/WeCom makes it easier to connect an existing organizational structure or configure permission policies for external members.

## Creating Collaborator

An admin user can set the **Tencent Cloud accounts** of other team members as collaborators and grant them access to cloud resources and bind permission policies to them. For detailed directions, see [Creating Collaborator](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/32639).
