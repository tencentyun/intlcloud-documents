## Unblocking Procedure
### Auto unblocking
With auto unblocking, you only need to wait until blocked IPs are unblocked automatically. You can check the predicted unblocking time as follows:
1. Log in to the [Anti-DDoS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ddos/unblock/list), select **Self-Service Unblocking** > **Unblock Blocked IP** on the left sidebar to get to unblocking operation.
2. Check the predicted unblocking time of an IP in **Estimated Unblocking Time** on the unblocking page.

### Manual unblocking
You can perform unblocking earlier as follows:
>?
>- Only **three** chances of self-service unblocking are provided for Anti-DDoS Pro or Advanced users every day. The system resets the chance counter daily at midnight. Unused chances cannot be accumulated for the next day.
>- If the attack persists, you cannot perform unblocking. You need to wait for the attack to end before manual unblocking or auto unblocking.

1. Log in to the [Anti-DDoS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ddos/unblock/list), select **Self-Service Unblocking** > **Unblock Blocked IP** on the left sidebar to get to unblocking operation.
2. Find the protected IP in **Pending Auto Unblocking** and click **Unblock** in the **Operation** column on the right.

3. Click **OK** in the **Unblock Blocked IP** dialog box. If you receive a notification indicating successful unblocking, the IP has been successfully unblocked. You can refresh the page to check whether the protected IP is in running status.


## Unblocking Operation Record
Log in to the [Anti-DDoS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ddos/unblock/log), select **Self-Service Unblocking** > **Unblocking History** on the left sidebar. You can check all unblocking records in the specified period, including records of automatic unblocking and manual unblocking.
