## Overview
Anti-DDoS Advanced (Global Enterprise Edition) is a paid product that enhances DDoS protection capabilities for businesses deployed on Tencent Cloud.
- Anti-DDoS Advanced (Global Enterprise Edition) owns ten Tencent Cloud entries around the world for handling bandwidth needs with all-out protection, making access to each node as smooth as possible.
- Anycast provides near-source cleansing and near-source reinjection, with up to TB-level protection capability. It ensures smooth traffic and low latency by cleansing attack traffic and then forwarding normal traffic back to the real server close to the region of your Anti-DDoS Advanced (Global Enterprise Edition) instance deployed. The instance will directly protect the target IP on Tencent Cloud.
