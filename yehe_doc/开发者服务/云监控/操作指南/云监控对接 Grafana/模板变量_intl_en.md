## Overview
[Templates and variables](https://grafana.com/docs/reference/templating/) are dashboard optimization features offered by Grafana to create highly reusable and interactive dashboards. They allow Grafana to get different metrics from data sources and provide a way to dynamically modify them without modifying dashboards. The Tencent Cloud Monitor App currently provides variables such as region, CVM instance, and TencentDB for MySQL instance.

>!All instance queries allow customizing drop-down list values by the `display` field, for example: `Namespace=QCE/REDIS&Action=DescribeInstances&Region=$region&display=${InstanceId}-${InstanceName}`. If `display` and `InstanceAlias` appear at the same time, the drop-down list will only show the values of `display`.

>!The `payload` parameter has been added since v2.1.0, which supports filtering instances in template variables; for example:
`Namespace=QCE/CVM&Action=DescribeInstances&Region=ap-guangzhou&InstanceAlias=InstanceId&payload={"Filters":[{"Name":"zone","Values":["ap-guangzhou-1"]}]}` can filter instances in the `Guangzhou Zone 1` AZ. Note: the `payload` parameter is a strict JSON string.

The following table lists currently available template variables:

## Creating Variable

1. Go to a dashboard and click the **gear** icon in the upper-right corner to go to the dashboard settings page.
2. Click **Variables** on the left to go to the variable configuration page and then click `+ Add variable` to go to the variable editing page.

## Editing Variable

- `Name`: variable name, which is typically an English string and can be used to replace the original specific value in the dashboard.
- `Label`: visible label of the variable, which is used to describe the variable name more explicitly. For example, if `Name` is set to `region`, `Label` can be set to `Region`.
- `Type`: variable query method. Here, only `Query` can be selected, which means to send a request to the data source to get the variable list.
- `Data source`: data source from which to get the variable list. You can select any configured Tencent Cloud Monitor data source.
- `Refresh`: variable refresh method, which defines when the variable data is refreshed.
- `Query`: variable query statement. For more information, see the variable examples and descriptions in the above table.

After all the variable information is completed, you can preview the variable values obtained from a query at the bottom of the page. If they are correct as expected, you can click `Add` to add the variable. After the variable is added successfully, click `Save` in the right menu to save it in the dashboard configuration.

The following shows how to configure the region and CVM instance variables by taking the CVM single-instance monitoring dashboard as an example:

>?If you want to monitor multiple instances, select `Multi-value`.

## Applying Variable
After the variables are created, selection boxes will be displayed in the top-left corner of the dashboard page, where you can switch the variable values. Variables can be imported with two syntaxes: `$varname` and `[[varname]]`. Variables are often used in panel query statements. The following shows how to use variables in queries by taking the CVM single-instance monitoring dashboard as an example. In addition, variables can also be used in panel titles and text panels.
