TMP allows you to modify the data storage period after creating an instance. The longer the storage period, the higher the unit price of the instance. For billing details, see [Pay-as-You-Go](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1116/43156).

1. Log in to the [TMP console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor/prometheus).
2. In the instance list, find the target TMP instance and click **More** > **Instance Configuration** > **Modify Storage Period** on the right.
