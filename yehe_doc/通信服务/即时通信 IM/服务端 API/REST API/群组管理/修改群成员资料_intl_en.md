## Feature Description
 This API is used by app admins to modify group members’ profiles.

## API Calling Description
### Applicable group types

| Group Type ID | Is this RESTful API Supported? |
|-----------|------------|
| Private | Yes. Same as Work (work group for friends) in the new version. |
| Public | Yes. |
| ChatRoom | Yes. Same as Meeting (temporary meeting group) in the new version. |
|AVChatRoom|Yes. The group profiles can be modified.|

These are the 4 built-in group types in IM. For detailed information, see the [Group System](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529).

>Due to the internal implementation, AVChatRooms (livestreaming groups) only support modifying the member profiles of admins and the group owner. Error 10007 will be returned if you try to modify the profiles of ordinary group members.
