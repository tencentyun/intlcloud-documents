## Creating Rollup Task
In scenarios with massive amounts of data, a business system can generate petabytes of data per day or even per hour. Time series data is generally massive in amount, time-sensitive, and trending. Therefore, systems using such data (e.g., monitoring or data analysis systems) often only need high-precision data in the most recent time period while downsampling historical data for storage. You can configure a rollup task to periodically aggregate historical data and save it into a new metric. A rollup task not only saves downsampled historical data, but also improves query performance and reduces storage costs. Note that a rollup task automatically creates child metrics inheriting all configurations of the parent metric according to `base_metric`, and the parent metric configurations will be overwritten if `options` is specified.

### 1. Request address
The address is the instance IP and port, such as `10.13.20.15:9200`, which can be obtained in the console.

### 2. Request path and method
Path: `/_rollup/${rollup_task_name}`, where `${rollup_task_name}` is the rollup task name.
Method: PUT

### 3. Request parameters
None

### 4. Request content
| Parameter | Required | Type   | Description                                                         |
| ------------- | ---- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| base_metric   | Yes   | string | Name of the metric (parent metric) depended on by the rollup task                            |
| rollup_metric | Yes   | string | Name of the metric (child metric) generated by the rollup task                            |
| base_rollup   | No   | string | Rollup task depended on by the current rollup task. Before executing the current task, the system will check whether the dependent task in the corresponding time period has been completed  |
| query         | No   | string | Query condition for data filtering, which consist of many elements and operations, such as `name:host AND type:max OR region:gz` |
| group_by      | Yes   | Array  | Tag to be aggregated. Multiple tags can be included                               |
| function      | Yes   | Map    | Aggregate name, mode, and fields. The fields can be only from the `fields` field in `base_metric`. If the `fields` field is empty, the rollup cannot be configured. The function can be `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `set`, `any`, `first`, `last`, `percentiles`, etc., such as `{"cost_total":{"sum": {"field":"cost"}},"cpu_usage_avg":{ "avg": { "field":"cpu_usage"}}}` |
| interval      | Yes   | string | Aggregate granularity, such as 1s, 5m, 1h, and 1d |
| frequency     | No   | string | Scheduling frequency, such as 5m, 1h, and 1d, which is the same as `interval` by default                |
| delay         | No   | string | Execution delay. Generally, there should a certain delay for data write, such as 5m or 1h, in order to avoid data loss |
| start_time    | No   | string | Start time of periodic execution of the rollup task, which is the current time by default      |
| end_time      | No   | string | Scheduling end time, which is the maximum timestamp value by default          |
| options       | No   | map    | `rollup_metric` options, which are the same as the options for metric creation                   |

### 5. Response content
You need to judge whether a request is successful based on the `error` field. If the response content contains the `error` field, the request failed. For the error details, please see the `error` field description.
