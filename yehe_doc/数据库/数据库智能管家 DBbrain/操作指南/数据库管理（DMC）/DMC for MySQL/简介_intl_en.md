## Overview
Database Management Console (DMC) is a one-stop Tencent Cloud data management tool. Services supported include database/table-level operations, instance session management, real-time monitoring, InnoDB lock wait, and SQL window.

Currently, DMC supports TencentDB for MySQL, TencentDB for MariaDB, and TencentDB for CynosDB (compatible with MySQL). In addition, it has a built-in phpMyAdmin (PMA) management tool to help you manage your databases quickly and efficiently.
