DMC is currently supported for TencentDB for MySQL, TencentDB for MariaDB, TDSQL-C for MySQL, TencentDB for Redis, and TDSQL for MySQL.

## Features
- **Data management**
It supports database operations such as creating and deleting databases/tables, modifying table structures, and maintaining table data.

- **Database instance session management**
It displays multidimensional instance session information to help you easily view and perform relevant operations.

- **Database monitoring**
It supports multidimensional monitoring of database status, InnoDB row operations, database connections, and traffic.

## Benefits
- **Ease of use**
DMC aims to provide easy-to-use database management services. You can use the convenient operation interface to perform database operations such as creating databases/tables.

- **Visualization**
You do not need to separately install drivers or applications to use DMC. Instead, you just need to log in to the DMC console to manage, monitor, and manipulate databases in multiple dimensions through the visualization management page.

- **Real-Time database status monitoring**
DMC can collect database instance data in real time such as CPU utilization, number of connections, and storage capacity usage, so as to intuitively display database instance running conditions.

- **Real-Time database performance monitoring**
DMC supports database performance monitoring at the second level, covering multiple monitoring items related to MySQL status, InnoDB row operations, threads, and network to help you monitor fluctuations in each performance item in real time. In addition, it supports the categorized calculation of sessions and allows you to kill instance sessions, helping you quickly locate causes of exceptions and implement performance optimization.
