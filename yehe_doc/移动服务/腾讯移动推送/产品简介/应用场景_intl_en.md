### Social Networking
- Scenario description: when a user performs an operation such as liking, commenting, or sharing in an application with social networking features, the application can call the TPNS service to send a reminder message to target users, who can receive the reminder without opening the application. This can promote repeated user interaction, which helps form a closed functionality loop and improve the user activity.
