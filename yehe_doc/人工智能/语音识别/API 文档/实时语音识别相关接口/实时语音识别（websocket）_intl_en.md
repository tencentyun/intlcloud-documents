>?This API is on v2.0 and is different from API 3.0 in terms of parameter styles and error codes.

## API Description
This API is used to recognize a real-time audio stream over the WebSocket protocol and return the recognition result synchronously. It achieves the effect of instant speech-to-text conversion.
Before using this API, you need to activate the service in the ASR console first. Then, go to the [Manage API Key](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi) page to create a key and generate `AppID`, `SecretID`, and `SecretKey` required for calculating authentication signatures during API call.

## API Requirements
When integrating the real-time speech recognition API, you need to comply with the following requirements:

| Item | Description |
|---------|---------|
| Language | Supported languages include Mandarin, English, Japanese, Bahasa, Vietnamese, Malay, and Filipino. You can set the language through the `engine_model_type` parameter. |
| Industry | General, finance, gaming, education, and healthcare. |
| Audio attribute | Sample rate: 16000 Hz or 8000 Hz <br>Bit depth: 16 bits<br>Channel: mono |
| Audio format | PCM, WAV, Opus, Speex, SILK, MP3, M4A, and AAC |
| Request protocol | WSS |
| Request address | wss://asr.cloud.tencent.com/asr/v2/&lt;appid&gt;?{request parameter} |
| API authentication | Signature-based authentication. For more information, see [Signature generation](#sign). |
| Response format | JSON |
| Data sending | We recommend you send a packet of 40 ms in length every 40 ms (i.e., real-time factor (RTF) of 1:1). The corresponding PCM is 640 bytes at a sample rate of 8 kHz or 1,280 bytes at a sample rate of 16 kHz. <br>An audio sending rate exceeding the 1:1 RTF or an audio packet sending interval exceeding 6 seconds may cause an error in the engine. In this case, the backend will return an error and close the connection. |
| Concurrency limit | The number of concurrent connections per account is 50. If you need more concurrent connections, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for application. |

## API Call Process
The API call process can be divided into two phases: handshake and recognition. In both phases, the backend returns a text message containing a serialized JSON string in the following format:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
| code | Integer | The status code. 0: normal; other values: an error occurred. |
| message | String | The error message. This field explains the cause of the error. Note that the returned messages are subject to changes as the service is updated or optimized. |
| voice_id | String | The unique ID of the audio stream, which is generated by the client during the handshake and assigned in the call parameters. |
| message_id | String | The unique ID of the message. |
| result | Result | The latest speech recognition result. |
| final | Integer | If this field returns `1`, all of the audio stream has been recognized. |

The structure of the recognition result `Result` is in the following format:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
| slice_type | Integer | The recognition result type.<li>0: started recognizing a paragraph <li>1: recognizing a paragraph, where `voice_text_str` indicates an unstable result (the recognition result of the paragraph may change) <li>2: stopped recognizing a paragraph, where `voice_text_str` indicates a stable result (the recognition result of the paragraph will not change) <br>Depending on the sent audio, the following `slice_type` sequence may be returned: <br><li>0-1-2: started recognizing a paragraph, recognizing a paragraph (`1` may be returned multiple times), stopped recognizing a paragraph<br><li>0-2: started recognizing a paragraph, stopped recognizing a paragraph <br> <li>2: returned the complete recognition result of a paragraph |
| index | Integer | The number of the result of the current paragraph in the entire audio stream, which increases from 0. |
| start_time | Integer | The start time of the result of the current paragraph in the entire audio stream |
| end_time | Integer | The end time of the result of the current paragraph in the entire audio stream |
| voice_text_str | String | The text result of the current paragraph encoded in UTF8 |
| word_size | Integer | The number of word results of the current paragraph |
| word_list | Word Array | The list of words contained in the current paragraph. The structure of a word is in the following format:<br>word: the content of the word in string type <br>start_time: the start time of the word in the entire audio stream in integer type <br>end_time: the end time of the word in the entire audio stream in integer type <br>stable_flag: the status of the result in integer type. 0: unstable; 1: stable. |

### Handshake phase
#### Request format
During the handshake, the client initiates a WebSocket connection request with a URL in the following format:
```
wss://asr.cloud.tencent.com/asr/v2/<appid>?{request parameter}
```
Here, the &lt;appid&gt; needs to be replaced with the `AppID` of your Tencent Cloud account, which can be obtained on the [Manage API Key](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi) page. The format of the {request parameter} is as follows:
```
key1=value2&key2=value2... (both `key` and `value` need to be URL-encoded)
```

Parameter description:

| signature | Yes | String | The API signature parameter. |

**Signature generation**[](id:sign)
1. Sort all parameters except `signature` in lexicographical order to concatenate them into the request URL as the original signature string. Here, `Appid=1259228442, SecretId=AKIDoQq1zhZMN8dv0psmvud6OUKuGPO7pu0r` is concatenated into the string as follows:
```
asr.cloud.tencent.com/asr/v2/1259228442?engine_model_type=16k_zh&expired=1592380492&filter_dirty=1&filter_modal=1&filter_punc=1&needvad=1&nonce=1592294092123&secretid=AKIDoQq1zhZMN8dv0psmvud6OUKuGPO7pu0r&timestamp=1592294092&voice_format=1&voice_id=RnKu9FODFHK5FPpsrN
```
2. Encrypt the original signature string by using `SecretKey` with HMACSHA1 and then Base64-encode it. For example, perform this operation on the original signature string generated in the previous step with `SecretKey=kFpwoX5RYQ2SkqpeHgqmSzHK7h3A2fni` to get:
```
Base64Encode(HmacSha1("asr.cloud.tencent.com/asr/v2/1259228442?engine_model_type=16k_zh&expired=1592380492&filter_dirty=1&filter_modal=1&filter_punc=1&needvad=1&nonce=1592294092123&secretid=AKIDoQq1zhZMN8dv0psmvud6OUKuGPO7pu0r&timestamp=1592294092&voice_format=1&voice_id=RnKu9FODFHK5FPpsrN", "kFpwoX5RYQ2SkqpeHgqmSzHK7h3A2fni"))
```
The obtained `signature` value is as follows:
```
HepdTRX6u155qIPKNKC+3U0j1N0=
```
3. After the value of `signature` is **URL-encoded (URL-encoding is required; otherwise, authentication may fail**), the final request URL obtained through concatenation is:
```
wss://asr.cloud.tencent.com/asr/v2/1259228442?engine_model_type=16k_zh&expired=1592380492&filter_dirty=1&filter_modal=1&filter_punc=1&needvad=1&nonce=1592294092123&secretid=AKIDoQq1zhZMN8dv0psmvud6OUKuGPO7pu0r&timestamp=1592294092&voice_format=1&voice_id=RnKu9FODFHK5FPpsrN&signature=HepdTRX6u155qIPKNKC%2B3U0j1N0%3D
```

#### Opus audio stream encapsulation description[](id:jump)
The size of a compressed frame should be fixed at 640, which means compressing 640 shorts at a time; otherwise, decompression will fail. The spliced frames can be passed to the server, and each frame must meet the following format requirements:
Each frame of compressed data is encapsulated as follows:

| OpusHead (four bytes) | Frame data length (two bytes) | One frame of compressed Opus data |
|---------|---------|---------|
| opus | Length (`len`) | Opus-decoded data in the length of `len` |

#### Request response
After the client initiates a connection request, the backend will establish a connection and verify the signature. If the verification is passed, the backend will return an acknowledgment message with the code 0 to indicate that the handshake is successful; otherwise, the backend will return a message with a code other than `0` and close the connection.
```
 {"code":0,"message":"success","voice_id":"RnKu9FODFHK5FPpsrN"}
```

### Recognition phase
After the handshake is successful, the backend will proceed to the recognition phase, where the client uploads audio data and receives the recognition result messages.

#### Uploading data
During recognition, the client continuously uploads binary messages containing binary audio stream data to the backend. We recommend you send a packet of 40 ms in length every 40 ms (i.e., real-time factor (RTF) of 1:1). The corresponding PCM is 640 bytes at a sample rate of 8 kHz or 1,280 bytes at a sample rate of 16 kHz. An audio sending rate exceeding the 1:1 RTF or an audio packet sending interval exceeding 6 seconds may cause an error in the engine. In this case, the backend will return an error and close the connection.
After the audio stream is uploaded, the client needs to send the following text message to the backend to end the recognition.
```
{"type": "end"}
```

#### Receiving a message
While uploading data, the client needs to receive the real-time recognition result returned by the backend synchronously. Below is a sample result:
```
 {"code":0,"message":"success","voice_id":"RnKu9FODFHK5FPpsrN","message_id":"RnKu9FODFHK5FPpsrN_11_0","result":{"slice_type":0,"index":0,"start_time":0,"end_time":1240,"voice_text_str":"real-time","word_size":0,"word_list":[]}}
```

```
{"code":0,"message":"success","voice_id":"RnKu9FODFHK5FPpsrN","message_id":"RnKu9FODFHK5FPpsrN_33_0","result":{"slice_type":2,"index":0,"start_time":0,"end_time":2840,"voice_text_str":"real-time speech recognition","word_size":0,"word_list":[]}}
```
After the backend recognizes all the uploaded audio data, it will return a message with the value of `final` being `1` and close the connection.
```
{"code":0,"message":"success","voice_id":"CzhjnqBkv8lk5pRUxhpX","message_id":"CzhjnqBkv8lk5pRUxhpX_241","final":1}
```
If an error occurs during recognition, the backend will return a message with a code other than 0 and close the connection.
```
{"code":4008,"message":"The backend recognition server timed out while waiting for an audio segment.","voice_id":"CzhjnqBkv8lk5pRUxhpX","message_id":"CzhjnqBkv8lk5pRUxhpX_241"}
```
