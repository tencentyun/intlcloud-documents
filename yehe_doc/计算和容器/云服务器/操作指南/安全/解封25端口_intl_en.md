## Introduction
This article describes how to unblock port 25.

## Notes

- You can only unblock port 25 for five instances for each Tencent Cloud account.
- Make sure that you only use port 25 to connect to a third-party SMTP server for sending email. If you use your CVMs to send email directly, we reserve the right to permanently ban you from opening port 25.

## Directions

1. Log in to the [Tencent Cloud console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com).
2. Click your account name in the upper-right corner. Select **[Security Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/secctrl)**.
3. In the left sidebar, click **Unblock port 25** to go to the **Unblock port 25** page.
4. Click **Apply for unblocking TCP port 25** to bring up the **Apply for unblocking TCP port 25** window.
5. Select a region and the CVM instance that need to be unblocked. Select **I have read and agree to the port 25 usage agreement.**, as shown below:
> Make sure you have not used up your unblocking quota. You can check the remaining quota in the lower left of the **Apply for unblocking TCP port 25** window.
