Lighthouse is billed for the following three parts: **[basic package](#basis)**, **[excessive traffic](#additional)**, and **[custom image](#customizeOS)**.


## [Basic Package Overview](id:basis)
Lighthouse is sold as instance packages at favorable prices, which contain Tencent Cloud server resources such as CPU, memory, SSD cloud disk, and network traffic package. If the resources in a package cannot meet your requirements, you can apply for additional resources by purchasing excessive traffic.



### Billing mode
The basic package currently is available only through monthly subscription. Monthly subscription is a prepaid billing mode, where you need to pay the fees for one or multiple months or even years in advance. Here, the duration of monthly subscription is calculated by calendar month. For example: 
If you purchased Lighthouse at 00:00 on February 10, 2020 for 1 month, the monthly subscription duration would be 00:00:00 on February 10–23:59:59 on March 10. 
If you purchased Lighthouse at 00:00 on May 1, 2020 for 1 month, the monthly subscription duration would be 00:00:00 on May 1–23:59:59 on May 31.

### Overdue payments and service suspension
An instance will enter the **to be repossessed** status upon expiration and can be recovered if you renew it within seven days. 
If you don't renew an instance when it is in the **to be repossessed** status period, it will be released, and its data will be cleared and cannot be recovered. For more information, please see [Repossession Mechanism](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1103/41405). Please pay attention to the instance status and renew or transfer data promptly.

### Traffic package
Lighthouse packages are offered in the form of traffic package, which counts only the instance outbound traffic billed in the following way:
 - **If the monthly used traffic is within the limit of the monthly traffic package**, the traffic package will be reset monthly starting from the purchase time.
 - **If the monthly used traffic exceeds the monthly traffic package limit**, the excessive traffic will be billed by usage.
