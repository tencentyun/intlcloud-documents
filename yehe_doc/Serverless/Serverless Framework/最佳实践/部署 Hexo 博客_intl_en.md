## Overview
This document describes how to use the Serverless Website component to quickly construct a serverless Hexo website. 

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) has been installed (**starting from September 1, 2020, Serverless components no longer support Node.js versions below 10.0. Please upgrade if needed**).
- You have installed [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

If the applications above are not installed, please install them as instructed in the [Hexo documentation](https://hexo.io/zh-cn/docs/).




## Directions
### 1. Install
Install Serverless Framework through npm:
```
$ npm install -g serverless
```

Install Hexo through npm:
```
$ npm install -g hexo-cli
```

After installing Hexo, please run the following command to make Hexo create required files in the specified folder:
```
$ hexo init hexo   # Generate a Hexo directory
$ cd hexo
$ npm install
```

After the specified folder is created, its structure is as follows:
```
.
├── _config.yml
├── package.json
├── scaffolds
├── source
|   ├── _drafts
|   └── _posts
└── themes
```

After the installation is completed, run the `hexo g` command to generate a static webpage:
```
$ hexo g   # generate
```

>?If you want to view the result locally, you can run the following command to access `localhost:4000` and view the webpage in a browser:

```
$ hexo s   # server
```

### 2. Configure
Create a `serverless.yml` file in the `hexo` directory:
```
$ touch serverless.yml
```
Configure the `serverless.yml` file as follows:
```yml
# serverless.yml

component: website # Name of the imported component, which is required. The `tencent-website` component is used in this example
name: hexodemo # Name of the instance created by this `website` component, which is required

app: websiteApp # Website application name, which is optional
stage: dev # Information for identifying environment, which is optional. The default value is `dev`

inputs:
  src:
    src: ./public # Upload static files generated by HEXO
    index: index.html
    # dist: ./dist
    # hook: npm run build
    # websitePath: ./
  region: ap-guangzhou
  bucketName: my-bucket
  protocol: https
  
```

After the configuration is completed, the directory structure is as follows:
```
.
├── .serverless
└── hexo
    ├── public
    ├── ...
    ├── serverless.yml 
    ├── ...
    └── source

```

### 3. Deploy
Deploy by running the `sls deploy` command, and you can add the `--debug` parameter to view the information during the deployment process:
```
$ sls deploy

serverless ⚡ framework
Action: "deploy" - Stage: "dev" - App: "websiteApp" - Instance: "hexodemo"

region:  ap-guangzhou
website: https://my-bucket-1258834142.cos-website.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com


25s › hexodemo › Success
```

You can view your serverless Hexo website by accessing the website URL output by the command line.

>!If you want to update an article in your Hexo website, you need to run `hexo g` locally again to generate a static webpage and run `serverless` to update the webpage.

### 4. Remove

You can run the following command to remove the Hexo website:
```console
$ sls remove --debug

  DEBUG ─ Flushing template state and removing all components.
  DEBUG ─ Starting Website Removal.
  DEBUG ─ Removing Website bucket.
  DEBUG ─ Removing files from the "my-bucket-1250000000" bucket.
  DEBUG ─ Removing "my-bucket-1250000000" bucket from the "ap-guangzhou" region.
  DEBUG ─ "my-bucket-1250000000" bucket was successfully removed from the "ap-guangzhou" region.
  DEBUG ─ Finished Website Removal.

### Account configuration (optional)
Currently, you can scan a QR code to log in to the CLI by default. If you want to configure persistent environment variables/key information, you can also create a local `.env` file:
```
$ touch .env # Tencent Cloud configuration information
```

Configure Tencent Cloud's `SecretId` and `SecretKey` information in the `.env` file and save it:
```env
# .env
TENCENT_SECRET_ID=123
TENCENT_SECRET_KEY=123
```
>?
>- If you don't have a Tencent Cloud account yet, please [sign up](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/register) first.
>- If you already have a Tencent Cloud account, you can get `SecretId` and `SecretKey` in [API Key Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi).
