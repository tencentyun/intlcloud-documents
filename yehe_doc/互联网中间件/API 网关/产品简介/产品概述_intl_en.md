API Gateway implements full-lifecycle API management to help you easily manage APIs in different stages such as creation, maintenance, release, and monitoring. With the aid of API Gateway, you can encapsulate various backend businesses into APIs for service provision to users. In addition, API Gateway makes it easy for you to manage API documentation, test APIs, and generate SDKs.

If a customer wants to use API gateway services or a provider wants to provide its business through Tencent Cloud Marketplace, they can use API Gateway. The provider can deploy its businesses on API Gateway, so that end users can directly call the API services with the corresponding domain names through mobile clients, web clients, IoT, or other applications.
