## Pay-As-You-Go by Monthly 95th Percentile
### Arrears notification
1. Arrears notification: you will receive a notification when your account balance becomes negative.

### Arrears policy
The arrears policy is applied from the moment when the balance drops to 0. The details are as follows:
1. Within seven days, Cloud Connect Network (CCN) is still available for the account.
2. Seven days later, the CCN instance becomes unavailable and the cross-region bandwidth drops to 0 Kbps if your account balance is still negative. However, the CCN instance retains and resumes service once you top up your account.
