### What's the billing mode for VPN connections?
- VPN tunnels and customer gateways are free of charge, but VPN gateways are charged.
- VPN gateways can be billed in pay-as-you-go mode. For details, see [Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1037/32685).

For additional VPC pricing information, see [Purchase Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/35500).

### Why can't I renew or upgrade VPN gateways?
A VPN gateway cannot be renewed and upgraded at the same time. If you have an unpaid renewal or upgrade order, other renewal or upgrade operations cannot be performed. The system invalidates unpaid renewal or upgrade orders at 24:00 every day, after which you must re-submit your order.

### Will I receive a reminder when my VPN gateway expires?
For more information, please see [Expiration Notifications](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1037/32687).

### Is SSL VPN supported?
