1. Log in to [VPC Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/vpc?rid=1).
2. In the left sidebar, choose **VPN Connection** -> **VPN Gateway** to go to the management page.
3. Choose a region (**Guangzhou** in this example), and click **+New**.
>? If the **+New** button is grayed out, and prompts “No available VPC” when you hover over it, [create a VPC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31805) before creating the VPN gateway. 

4. Enter the gateway name, such as TomVPNGw. Select the associate network, the network, the bandwidth cap, and the billing method, and click **Create**. After the VPN gateway is created, the system randomly assigns it a public IP address such as `203.195.147.82`.
