## API Description
This API is used to create a CLB instance. To use the CLB service, you first need to purchase one or more instances. After this API call succeeds, a unique instance ID will be returned. There are two types of instances: public network and private network instances. For more information, see the “network types” in [CLB Attributes Selection](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/13629).
 
Domain name for API calls: `lb.api.qcloud.com`

## Request Parameters
The list below contains only the API request parameters. Common parameters should be added when you call the API. For more information, see [Common Request Parameters](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/11594). The `Action` field for this API is `CreateLoadBalancer`.

| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|--|
| loadBalancerType | No | Int | Network type of the CLB instance.<br>2: public network; 3: private network. |
| forward | No | Int | CLB instance type. 1: CLB; 0: Cassic CLB. Default value: 0. |
| loadBalancerName | No | String | CLB instance name, which takes effect only when an instance is created. Rule: 1-50 letters, Chinese, digits, dashes (-), or underscores (_).<br>Note: If this name is the same as that of an existing CLB instance, the system will automatically generate a name for this newly created instance. |
| domainPrefix | No | String | Domain name prefix. The domain name of the CLB instance consists of the user-defined domain prefix and the domain suffix automatically generated by Tencent Cloud to ensure the uniqueness. This field is only applicable to Classic CLB instances.<br> Rule: 1-20 lowercase letters, digits or dashes (-). This field is inapplicable to private network CLB.<br>Note: if this domain name prefix is the same as that of an existing CLB instance, the system will automatically generate a domain name prefix for this newly created instance. For example, you only need to enter the prefix "xxxxx" for xxxxx.region.appId.clb.myqcloud.com.
| vpcId | No | String | Network ID of the CLB instance, which can be obtained via the DescribeVpcEx API. If no value or “0” is passed in, the network is <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31807" title="Classic Network">Classic Network</a>.|
| subnetId | No | Int | A subnet ID specified when you purchase a private network CLB instance in a VPC. The VIP of this instance will be generated in the subnet. This parameter can be left empty in other cases. |
| projectId | No | Int | ID of the project to which a CLB instance belongs, which can be obtained via the DescribeProject</a> API. If this parameter is not passed in, the default project will be used.|
| number | No | Int | Number of CLB instances to be created. Default value: 1. |



 

## Response Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-------|---|---------------|
| code | Int | Common error code. 0: success; other values: failure. For more information, see [Common Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/11602#.E5.85.AC.E5.85.B1.E9.94.99.E8.AF.AF.E7.A0.81). |
| message | String | API-related module error message description. |
| codeDesc | String | Error code. For a successful operation, "Success" is returned. For a failed operation, a message describing the failure is returned. |
| unLoadBalancerIds | Array | Array of unique CLB instance IDs. |
| requestId | Int | Task ID. |
| dealIds | Array | Reserved field. |



## Example
 
Purchasing three public network CLB instances with static IPs
```
https://lb.api.qcloud.com/v2/index.php?Action=CreateLoadBalancer
&<Common request parameters>
&loadBalancerType=2
&number=3
```
Response
```
{
    "code": 0,
    "message": "",
    "codeDesc": "Success",
    "requestId": 3901942,
    "dealIds": [
        "3901942"
    ],
    "unLoadBalancerIds": {
        "3901942": [
            "lb-cjcymkw9",
            "lb-fpk0oxhp",
            "lb-ikpzv02x"
        ]
    }
}
```
Where, lb-cjcymkw9 is the unique ID of the CLB instance you just purchased. Next, use the [DescribeLoadBalancers](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/1261) API to query whether the CLB instance has been successfully created.
