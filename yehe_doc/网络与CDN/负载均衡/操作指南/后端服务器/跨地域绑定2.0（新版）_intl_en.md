CLB supports binding CVM instances across regions through CCN, allowing you to select real servers of different regions and bind CLB instances to them across VPCs or regions.
This feature is currently in beta test. To try it out, [submit a ticket](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/apply/p/mzjxboiv2yq) for application.

>?
>- Cross-region CVM binding is currently not supported for classic CLB instances.
>- This feature is available only to bill-by-IP accounts. To check your account type, see [Checking Account Type](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/684/15246).
>- Cross-region binding 2.0 and hybrid cloud deployment do not support [Allow Traffic by Default in security groups](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/14733), for which you need to allow the client IP and service port on the real server.


## Use Cases
1. The cross-region binding feature can well meet the needs in P2P gaming scenarios where the same server is shared by players from different regions. For example, if your real server cluster is deployed in Guangzhou, you can create CLB instances in Shanghai and Beijing and bind them to the same real server cluster in Guangzhou to achieve game acceleration and traffic convergence, ensuring the data transfer quality and reducing the latency.
2. This feature can ensure the transfer quality and data consistency in key business transactions, meeting the stringent requirements of the financial industry and payment scenarios.

## Prerequisites
1. You have submitted the application for beta test eligibility. For cross-region binding in the Chinese mainland, [submit a ticket](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/apply/p/mzjxboiv2yq) for application. For cross-region binding outside the Chinese mainland, [contact your Tencent Cloud rep](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/contact-sales).
2. You have created a CLB instance. For more information, see [Creating CLB Instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/6149).
3. You have created a CCN instance. For more information, see [Creating a CCN Instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30062).
4. Associate the target VPC with the created CCN instance. For more information, see [Associating Network Instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30064).


## Directions
1. Log in to the [CLB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/loadbalance).
2. On the **Instance Management** page, click the ID of the target CLB instance.
3. On the **Basic Info** tab of the **Real Server** section, click **Configure** to bind a private IP of another VPC.

4. Click **Submit** in the pop-up dialog box.

5. In the **Real Server** section on the **Basic Info** tab, you can see that **Binding IP of Other VPCs** is enabled, which indicates that in-cloud IPs can be bound to.

6. On the instance details page, open the **Listener Management** tab, and bind a real server to the CLB instance in the listener configuration section. For more information, see [Managing Real Servers](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/6156).
7. In the pop-up box, select **Other VPC**, click **CVM**, select one or multiple target CVM instances, enter the forwarding port and weight, and click **Confirm**. For more information on ports, see [Server Common Port](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/12451).
