## Billable Items
Global Application Acceleration Platform (GAAP) is a pay-as-you-go service, and billable items include the following:
- **Connection fee** refers to the cost of resources (dedicated connection, forwarding server, etc.) used to create an acceleration connection. The fee is related to the concurrency capability of the connection. Refer to the [console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/gaap) for final prices.
- **Bandwidth fee** refers to the cost of bandwidth consumed by an acceleration connection. Each connection is billed independently on a daily basis according to the price range within which the actual peak bandwidth falls using tiered prices. Refer to the [console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/gaap) for final prices.

>A disabled connection does not incur any bandwidth fee but a connection fee. To stop incurring any connection fee, you need to delete the connection.

## Overdue Payment
When your Tencent Cloud account becomes overdue, Tencent Cloud will notify you through SMS, email, etc. A 24-hour grace period is provided for you. If you fail to top up your account within 24 hours, the GAAP service will be suspended for you.
>The configurations of your acceleration connections will be kept for 7 days, such as the listener configuration and origin server configuration. If your account is topped up within 7 days, the acceleration service will be resumed; otherwise, your acceleration connection will be terminated and can no longer be resumed.
