## Scenario
You can bind one or multiple security groups to a CVM instance. If a CVM instance is bound with multiple security groups, the security groups are executed based on the priority level (such as 1 and 2). You can adjust the priority of security groups as described below.

## Prerequisites
The CVM instance is bound to two or more security groups.

## Directions
1. Log into the [CVM Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/index).
2. In the instance management page, click the ID of the CVM instance to go to the details page.
3. Select the **Security Groups** tab to go to the security group management page.
4. In the **Bound Security Groups** section on the right, click **Order**.
