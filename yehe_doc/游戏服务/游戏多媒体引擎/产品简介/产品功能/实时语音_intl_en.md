## Overview

### 3D voice
GME's 3D voice feature enables players to hear a stereo voice with a sense of direction from characters when characters move. The voice also gets weaker as the distance from the source increases, making the game voice more immersive. For more information, see [3D Sound Effect](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/607/18218).

### Range voice
GME determines whether players can chat with each other based on their positions. In the same voice room, a large number of users can turn on their mic to have a voice call. It provides "team only" and "everyone" voice modes unique to battle royale and survival shooter games. For more information, see [Range Voice](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/607/17972).

### Room management
GME provides SDKs for you to implement room member management, mic-on/off, and muting. You can also use server APIs to remove players from a room and perform other operations.For more information, see [Integrating GME Chat Room Management](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/607/51115).
