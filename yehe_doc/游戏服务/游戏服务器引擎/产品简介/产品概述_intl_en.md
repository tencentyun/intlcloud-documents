### Voice Chat Service

#### 3D sound effects
Leveraging HRTF (Head Related Transfer Function), 3D spatial processing, and distance-based EQ compensation technologies, GME can create a voice model based on human perception to process and convert non-directional sound into 3D immersive sound, thereby generating the sound sensation to human ears as if from a sound source at any spatial position.

#### Public messaging
Public voice within a certain range with 3D sound effects in 6 directions is supported.

#### Free audio call
This mode allows multiple players to speak at the same time with ultra low latency, which is suitable for competitive gaming scenarios such as multi-player team chat.


### Voice Message and Speech-to-text Service
GME supports sending recorded voice messages to game channels and converting them into text messages in real time, with clear sound quality and high accuracy of voice recognition.

### Voice Analysis Service
GME can intelligently recognize all kinds of illegal and inappropriate voice violations in game applications such as pornographic, abusive, advertising information.
