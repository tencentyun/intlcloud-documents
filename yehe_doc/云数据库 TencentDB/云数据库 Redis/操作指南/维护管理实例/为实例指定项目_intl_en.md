## Operation Scenarios
TencentDB for Redis supports assigning instances to different projects for easier management. Assigned instances can be reassigned to other projects.
>?
- Read-only instances and disaster recovery instances are associated instances of the master instance and should be in the same project as the master instance.
- Assigning and moving database instances across projects will not affect the services provided by the instances.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [Redis Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/redis). Select the target instance in the instance list and click **More** > **Assign to Project** at the top.
