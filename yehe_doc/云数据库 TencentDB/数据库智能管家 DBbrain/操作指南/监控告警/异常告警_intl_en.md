The exception alarms page displays the information overview of exception alarms (exceptions detected by "24/7 Exception Diagnosis") generated by database instances connected to DBbrain under your account.

>?Currently, exception alarm is supported only for TencentDB for MySQL (excluding the Basic Edition).


## Exception Alarm List
Log in to the [DBbrain Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dbbrain/monitor) and select **Exception Alarm** on the left sidebar.
The exception alarm list displays the basic information of the database instance (instance name/ID, private IP, AZ), risk level, diagnosis items, duration, and operations. In the search bar, you can search by instance ID, instance name, private IP, diagnosis item, etc. You can also filter instances by region and time.

- "Risk levels" include warning, alarm, severe, and critical. You can filter, aggregate, and search for alarms by field. You can also click **Details** to view specific information about the exception and the optimization advice for the exception.

- There are over 30 "diagnosis items" for exception diagnosis, such as slow SQL, master-slave switch, deadlock, uncommitted transaction, and OOM. You can filter, aggregate, and search for items by field. You can also sort them by duration.

## Detailed Description of Diagnosis Items
A diagnosis item is an item diagnosed intelligently, which can be divided into four categories: performance, availability, reliability, and maintainability. Each diagnosis item belongs to only one category.

| Diagnosis Item Name | Category | Description |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Connectivity check | Availability | Unable to connect to the database |
| Slow insertion, update, or deletion | Performance | There is a thread pending for a long time |
| Slow SQL | Performance | There is a thread that is in the status of temp table creation, temp table replication, result sorting, etc. |
| Row lock wait | Performance | There is a transaction with lock wait |
| Uncommitted transaction | Performance | There is a thread in sleep status for a long time |
| DDL statement metadata lock wait | Performance | There is a thread running DDL statements with metadata lock wait |
| INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statement metadata lock wait | Performance | There is a thread running IUD statements with metadata lock wait |
| SELECT statement metadata lock wait | Performance | There is a thread running SELECT statements with metadata lock wait |
| Deadlock | Reliability | A deadlock is detected in the monitoring data, and the deadlock information exists in `INNODB STATUS` |
| Read-only lock | Performance | There is a thread with global read-only lock wait |
| High number of active sessions | Performance | The number of active sessions exceeds three times the CPU specification of the database instance |
| High disk utilization | Reliability | The disk utilization is too high |
| Memory utilization | Reliability | The memory utilization is too high |
| High CPU utilization | Performance | The CPU utilization is too high |
| I/O replication thread interruption | Reliability | A replication monitoring metric is exceptional and triggers diagnosis, and there is an I/O thread exception in `SHOW SLAVE STUTAS` |
| SQL replication thread interruption | Reliability | A replication monitoring metric is exceptional and triggers diagnosis, and there is an SQL thread exception in `SHOW SLAVE STUTAS` |
| Replication delay caused by DDL | Reliability | A replication monitoring metric is exceptional and triggers diagnosis, and there is a thread running DDL statements with metadata lock wait |
| Replication delay caused by transaction | Reliability | A replication monitoring metric is exceptional and triggers diagnosis, and there is a thread in sleep status with metadata lock wait |
| Replication delay caused by read-only lock | Reliability | A replication monitoring metric is exceptional and triggers diagnosis, and there is a thread with global read-only lock wait |
| High-risk account | Maintainability | There are anonymous or password-free accounts |
| Big table | Maintainability | The size of a single table exceeds 10% of the instance disk specification |
| Master-slave switch | Availability | The master-slave switch monitoring metric is exceptional |
| Instance migration caused by server failure | Availability | The monitoring metric of instance migration due to server failure is exceptional |
| Read-only instance removal | Availability | The read-only instance removal monitoring metric is exceptional |
| Disk limit exceeded | Availability | The disk limit monitoring metric is exceptional |
| Memory limit exceeded | Availability | The memory limit monitoring metric is exceptional |
| OOM | Availability | The database memory is overloaded |
| Low hit rate of table open cache | Performance | The hit rate of the table open cache is low |
