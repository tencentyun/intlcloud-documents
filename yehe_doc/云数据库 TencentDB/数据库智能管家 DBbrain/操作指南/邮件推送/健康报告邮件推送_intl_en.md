DBbrain supports the feature of health report email push. Users can easily know about the health status of the database instance without logging in to the console.
To help more relevant business personnel know about the health status of the database instance in time, users can also customize the health reports and the recipients to send to as needed.

Currently, the health reports are generated by three methods: manual trigger, scheduled tasks and database inspection. All of these reports can be sent via email. Users can send the reports to the specified recipient’s email once the reports are created, or select the historical reports to send to the specified recipient's email.

>?Currently, health report email push is supported only for TencentDB for MySQL (excluding the basic single-node instance).
