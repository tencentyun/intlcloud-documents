It changes the definition of a schema.

## Synopsis

```sql
ALTER SCHEMA name RENAME TO newname
 
ALTER SCHEMA name OWNER TO newowner
```

## Description
`ALTER SCHEMA` changes the definition of a schema.

You must own the schema to use `ALTER SCHEMA`. To rename a schema you must also have the `CREATE` privilege for the database. To alter the owner, you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new owning role, and you must have the `CREATE` privilege for the database. **Note that superusers have all these privileges automatically.**

## Parameters
name
The name of an existing schema.

newname
The new name of the schema. The new name cannot begin with `pg_`, as such names are reserved for system schemas.

newowner
The new owner of the schema.

## Compatibility
There is no `ALTER SCHEMA` statement in the SQL standard.
