It removes a resource queue.

## Synopsis
```sql
DROP RESOURCE QUEUE queue_name
```

## Description
This command removes a resource queue from the database. To drop a resource queue, the queue cannot have any roles assigned to it, nor can it have any statements waiting in the queue. Only a superuser can drop a resource queue.

## Parameters
queue_name: The name of a resource queue to remove.

## Notes
Use `ALTER ROLE` to remove a user from a resource queue. To see all the currently active queries for all resource queues, perform the following query of the `pg_locks` table joined with the `pg_roles` and `pg_resqueue` tables:
```sql
SELECT rolname, rsqname, locktype, objid, transaction, pid, 
mode, granted FROM pg_roles, pg_resqueue, pg_locks WHERE 
pg_roles.rolresqueue=pg_locks.objid AND 
pg_locks.objid=pg_resqueue.oid;
```
To see the roles assigned to a resource queue, perform the following query of the `pg_roles` and `pg_resqueue` system catalog tables:
```sql
SELECT rolname, rsqname FROM pg_roles, pg_resqueue WHERE 
pg_roles.rolresqueue=pg_resqueue.oid;
```

## Examples
Remove a role from a resource queue (and move the role to the default resource queue, `pg_default`):
```sql
ALTER ROLE bob RESOURCE QUEUE NONE;
```
Remove the resource queue named `adhoc`:
```sql
DROP RESOURCE QUEUE adhoc;
```

## Compatibility
The `DROP RESOURCE QUEUE` statement is a database extension.
