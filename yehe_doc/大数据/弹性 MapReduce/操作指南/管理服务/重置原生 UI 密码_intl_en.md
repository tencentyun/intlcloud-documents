## Feature Overview
EMR provides a software WebUI entry for you to access the native UIs of components. It is required to authenticate access requests. The username is "root", and the default password is the one you entered when creating the cluster. You can reset the native UI password in the EMR Console if you forgot it. This document describes how to do so.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [EMR Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/emr), select **Cluster List**, and click the ID/Name of the target cluster to enter the cluster details page.
2. Click **Cluster Service** on the cluster details page and click **Reset Native UI Password** in the top-left corner to reset the password.
>The password must contain 8–16 characters in at least three of the following character types: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols (!@#%^\*). The first character cannot be a special symbol.
