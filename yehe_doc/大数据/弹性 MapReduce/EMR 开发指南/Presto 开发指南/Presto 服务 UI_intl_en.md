Presto is an open source distributed SQL query engine for running interactive analytic queries against data sources of all sizes ranging from gigabytes to petabytes. Presto was designed and written from the ground up for interactive analysis and approaches the speed of commercial data warehouses.
Presto allows querying data where it lives, including Hive, Cassandra, relational databases or even proprietary data stores. A single Presto query can combine data from multiple sources, allowing for analysis across your entire organization.

EMR integrates the native web UI of Presto, which you can see in the EMR Console. Log in to the [EMR Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/emr) and click the entry to Presto on the **Component Management** page.
