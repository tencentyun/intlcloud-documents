This document answers questions you may encounter when using Tencent Effect licenses.

### What are the relationships between a license, a license key, and the Tencent Effect SDK?
You need to obtain Tencent Cloud's permission to legitimately use the Tencent Effect SDK. Tencent Cloud grants this permission by issuing licenses. There are two types of licenses you can obtain: a trial license and a production license.

An SDK is a collection of software development tools that facilitate your creation of applications for different software packages, software frameworks, and operating systems. After obtaining a license to use the Tencent Effect SDK, you will get a license key and a license URL, which you need to provide to the SDK in order to unlock its features.

### How do I get a production license for Tencent Effect?
You need to purchase a Tencent Effect package before you can use the SDK in your project. Choose a package that fits your needs and, after payment, contact your sales rep. We will issue a production license to your account as soon as possible. For details, see [Pricing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1143/45371).

### What is the validity period of a license? How do I renew it after expiration?
- **Trial license**: A trial license is valid for 28 days after issuance. For example, if you applied for a trial license on January 1, 2022, and it was issued to your account on January 2, 2022, the license would expire at 00:00:00 on January 31, 2022.
- **Production license**: A production license is valid for a year (365 days) after issuance. For example, if you applied for a production license on January 1, 2022, and it was issued to your account on January 2, 2022, the license would expire at 00:00:00 on January 3, 2023.

### How do I upgrade or downgrade a Tencent Effect license?
The Tencent Effect SDK comes in [11 editions](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1143/45371). After your existing license expires, you can purchase a different package that better suits your needs. However, you cannot downgrade or upgrade a license within its validity period.

A trial license gives you access to S1-04, the most advanced and full-featured edition of the SDK. You can also switch to a production license that better suits your needs during the trial period.
