 **Upstream Bitrate**: it is the amount of audio/video data sent by the current user per second (in Kbps). Generally, the higher the value, the better the image quality.
 **Downstream Bitrate**: it is the amount of audio/video data received by the current user per second (in Kbps).
 **Lag**: a red vertical line indicates that a lag occurs. The longer the line, the more severe the lag.
