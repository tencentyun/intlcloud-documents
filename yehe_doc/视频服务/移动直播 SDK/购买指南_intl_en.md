## MLVB License Fee

- The Tencent Cloud Mobile Live Video Broadcasting (MLVB) basic edition license allows you to use the MLVB basic edition SDK on iOS and Android devices. If you want to purchase now, please [contact sales](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/contact-sales).

- Currently, Tencent Cloud provides a **free one-time demo** for the basic edition SDK. You can register an account on the [LVB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/license) and apply for the free basic edition SDK license. Please refer to the [License Purchase Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1071/38546) to apply for the trial license. We offer a free trial for 28 days.

- You can purchase MLVB SDK independently or together with other cloud services. If you wish to purchase just the MLVB SDK, you only need to pay the license fee. If you use the MLVB SDK together with LVB, you need to pay the basic fees generated during live streaming, such as the bandwidth fees, in addition to the SDK license fee. The fees are billed based on the standard LVB billing mode. You can select daily or monthly pay-as-you-go. For more information, see [Billing Details](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/2818).

## Overdue Payment

- License purchase does not involve overdue payment. However, if you purchase other cloud services on the Tencent Cloud platform, you will receive a notification to make payment if your Tencent Cloud account balance is insufficient. You can make payment within 24 hours when your account becomes past due. If you do not make payment within the specified time, you will not be able to log in to the console, which may affect the use of your license.
