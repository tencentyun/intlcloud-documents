If you are dissatisfied after purchasing a CAR concurrency pack, you may be able to return it unconditionally within five days. The five-day unconditional return is available only once for your account. The full payment amount will be refunded to your Tencent Cloud account. In addition to the one-time unconditional return, you can also perform a standard return. In this case, fees for consumed resources will be deducted from the refund, and **the remaining amount, including cash and credit, will be credited to your Tencent Cloud account.** You can perform the above operations in the console.

## Five-Day Unconditional Return

If you are dissatisfied after purchasing a concurrency pack, you may be able to return it unconditionally within five days after purchase. The specific rules are as detailed below:

1. You can return one CAR concurrent pack unconditionally within five days after purchase.
2. In the event that any return request is suspected to be abnormal/malicious, Tencent Cloud reserves the right to reject the request.

### Rules

For an order that meets the five-day unconditional return policy, the refunded amount is the **total amount paid for purchase**, including cash and credit amount.

## Standard Return
For orders that are not eligible for the five-day unconditional return policy, the refund policy is as follows:
You can return up to 199 monthly subscribed CAR concurrencies in the console in a self-service manner. In standard return mode, the refund amount is calculated at the daily subscription price, that is, **refund amount = paid monthly subscription fees - pay-as-you-go fees** (the minimum duration unit of pay-as-you-go billing is day).

### Notes on self-service CAR concurrency pack return
After you return a monthly subscribed concurrency pack in a self-service manner, once its status becomes **Terminating**, it will no longer incur any fees.

### Example background
You purchase an L CAR concurrency pack in the Singapore region for one month in a monthly subscribed manner at 200 USD/month.

### Five-day unconditional return
**Example**: You are not satisfied with it and want to return it five days after purchase, and this is your first time returning a concurrency pack.
**Refund amount** = 200 USD (actual payment amount).

### Standard return
- **Example 1.** You are not satisfied with it and want to return it five days after purchase, and this is your first time returning a concurrency pack.
  **Refund amount** = 200 USD (actual payment amount).
- **Example 2.** You are not satisfied with it and want to return it five days after purchase, and this is not your first time returning a concurrency pack. The total usage duration is two days and ten hours.
  **Refund amount** = actual payment amount - daily subscription price * number of days of resource usage = 200 - 20 * 3 = 140 USD.

>? 20 USD/day is the unit price of a daily subscribed concurrency pack with the same configuration.
