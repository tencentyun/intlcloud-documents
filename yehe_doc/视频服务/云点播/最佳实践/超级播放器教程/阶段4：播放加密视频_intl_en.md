## Overview

This document describes how to encrypt a video and use the superplayer to play back the encrypted video.

Before reading this document, please make sure that you have read [Stage 1. Play back a video with superplayer](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/38098) and [Stage 2. Play back a video with hotlink protection enabled](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/38292) in the Superplayer Guide. This document uses the account activated and the video uploaded in [stage 1](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/38098), and hotlink protection needs to be enabled as instructed in [stage 2](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/38292).

## Step 1. Encrypt a video
1. Select **Media Assets** > **[Video Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/media)** in the VOD console, select the target video (FileId: 528xxx3757278095), and click **Process Video**.
2. In the **Process Video** pop-up window:
 * Select **Task Flow** for **Processing Type**.
 * Select **SimpleAesEncryptPreset** for **Task Flow Template**.

>? 
>- `SimpleAesEncryptPreset` is a preset task flow, which uses template 12 for adaptive bitrate streaming, template 10 for cover generating, and template 10 for image sprite capturing.
>- Adaptive bitrate streaming with template 12 is to output an encrypted multi-bitrate stream.
3. Click **Confirm** and wait until the video status changes from **Processing** to **Normal**, which indicates that video processing is completed.

4. Click **Manage** in the **Operation** column of the video to enter the management page:
 * Select the **Basic Info** tab, and you can view the generated cover and output encrypted adaptive bitstream (template ID: 12).
 * Select the **Screenshot Info** tab, and you can view the generated image sprite (template ID: 10).


## Step 2. Preview video playback

In the previous step, you have uploaded and processed the video. Now, you can use the superplayer for web, iOS, and Android to quickly preview video playback.

1. Select **Media Assets** > **[Video Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/media)**, find the video uploaded and processed in **step 1**, click **Manage** in the **Operation** column, and select **Superplayer Preview**.
2. Select **basicDrmPreset** for **Playback Configuration**.

 >? `basicDrmPreset` is a preset superplayer configuration, which is used to output the adaptive bitstream with template 12 and the image sprite with template 10.
3. As hotlink protection is enabled for the default distribution domain name, you can set the hotlink protection expiration time and the preview duration on the **Playback Control** tab. You can use the default parameter settings here (the default expiration time of playback hotlink protection is 1 day, and the preview duration and maximum number of IPs allowed for playback are left empty).
 
4. In **Web Player**, click the button in the middle of the player, and you can play back the video on web.

## Step 3. Use a demo for verification

The superplayer requires a signature within its validity period to play back the encrypted video. You can use the signature tool to quickly generate a signature as shown below.

1. Enter the [Superplayer - Signature Generation Tool](https://vods.cloud.tencent.com/signature/super-player-sign.html) page and enter the following parameters:
 * **User appId**: `appId` of video `1400xxx357`(if a subapplication is used, enter the subapplication's `appId`).
 * **Video fileId**: video `FileId`, which is `528xxx3757278095`.
 * **Current Unix Timestamp**: current Unix time automatically generated by the tool, which does not need to be entered manually and is `1591756516` here.
 * **Superplayer Configuration**: preset superplayer configuration name: `basicDrmPreset`.
 * **Signature Expiration Unix Timestamp**: signature expiration time, which can be left empty. The signature will expire in 1 day by default.
 * **Link Expiration Time**: expiration time of key hotlink protection, which can be set to the hexadecimal Unix time after 6 hours: `5ee09b44`.
 * **Hotlink Protection Key**: previously obtained hotlink protection key, which is `2WExxx48eW`.
>!`basicDrmPreset` is a preset superplayer configuration, which is used to output the adaptive bitstream with template 12 and the image sprite with template 10.
2. Click **Generate Signature**, and the generated signature will be displayed in the **Signature Generation Result** text box.


After getting the superplayer signature, you can use the superplayer demos for [web](https://imgcache.qq.com/open/qcloud/video/tcplayer/examples/vod/tcplayer-vod-base.html), [Android](https://github.com/tencentyun/SuperPlayer_Android), and [iOS](https://github.com/tencentyun/SuperPlayer_iOS) for verification. For more information, please see the demo source code.
>?In **Media Assets** > **[Video Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/media)** > **Superplayer Preview** in the console, you can get the corresponding web player source code for video preview for your reference.

## Summary

At this point, you have understood how to encrypt a video and use the superplayer to play back the encrypted video.
