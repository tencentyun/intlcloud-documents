The LVB Console provides configurations for you to quickly implement basic features such as LVB domain name management, LVB stream management, transcoding and recording. In addition, it enables you to perform various operations such as web push, acceleration configuration, resource monitoring and log management. 

## Prerequisites

- You have activated the LVB service. 
- You have logged in to the [LVB Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/livestat).

## Overview

Click **Overview** on the left sidebar, and you can view the relevant data such as yesterday's traffic fees, real-time data of live streaming, number of concurrent connections, and the trends in billable bandwidth and traffic in the last few days, switch the billing mode, or change the time granularity. You can click **User Access Guide** in the top-right corner to view the directions for getting started with LVB.

### Billing overview

<table>
<thead><tr><th width="20%">Statistical Item</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Yesterday's traffic usage</td>
<td>It displays the fees incurred by the downstream traffic/bandwidth generated in yesterday's LVB playback. You can select <strong>daily traffic billing</strong> or <strong>daily bandwidth billing</strong> as the billing mode.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

**Switch the billing mode**
If the current billing mode is daily billing, you can click **Switch** in the **Yesterday's Traffic Usage** statistical item to view the billing mode switch reminder. Click **OK** to switch the billing mode. For more information on billing mode switch, please see [Billing Mode Change](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/30411).

For more information, see [LVB Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/2819).

### Today's data

It displays the downstream peak bandwidth, downstream traffic usage, and number of concurrent connections in LVB for today.

<table>
<thead><tr><th width="20%">Statistical Item</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Current downstream bandwidth</td>
<td>It displays the current downstream peak bandwidth generated by playback acceleration under all playback domain names.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Today's downstream traffic</td>
<td>It displays today's total downstream traffic generated by playback acceleration under all playback domain names.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Concurrent connections</td>
<td>If the playback protocol is RTMP or FLV, the number of concurrent connections is the number of online viewers. If the playback protocol is HLS, the number of concurrent connections dose not mean the number of online viewers.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>


### Usage trend

It mainly displays the LVB usage trends for today, yesterday, last 7 days, and last 30 days, including the "bandwidth trend" and "traffic trend".

<table>
<thead><tr><th width="20%">Statistical Item</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Bandwidth trend</td>
<td>It displays the total downstream peak bandwidth consumed by the acceleration service under all playback domain names in the queried time period.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Traffic trend</td>
<td>It displays the total downstream traffic consumed by the acceleration service under all playback domain names in the queried time period.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>



#### Change time granularity

The LVB Console allows you to change the time granularity used when viewing the trends in billable bandwidth or traffic by clicking **Time Granularity** and selecting the desired option on the right.
