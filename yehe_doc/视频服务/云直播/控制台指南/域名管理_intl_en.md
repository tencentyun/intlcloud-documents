## Note
CSS provides a test domain name `xxxx.livepush.myqcloud.com` by default. You can use it for push testing, but we do not recommend using it as the push domain name for your real business. This domain name cannot be deleted.

## Prerequisites
1. You have activated the [CSS](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/css) service.
2. You have added a [domain name](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/35970).



## Viewing a Domain Name
On the **[Domain Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/domainmanage)** page, you can view the CNAME configuration status, type, status, time of adding, and expiry time of an added domain name. To view details, click the domain name or **Manage** on its right.

## Configuring a Domain Name
If you need to configure a push domain name, please see [Push Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/31059).
If you need to configure a playback domain name, please see [Playback Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/31058).


## Disabling a Domain Name
To disable a domain name, click **Disable** on its right, and then click **OK** in the pop-up. After its status changes from **Enabled** to **Disabled**, it has been successfully disabled.
>? Once disabled, a domain name cannot be accessed. It can be accessed again after enabled. The steps of enabling and disabling are the same for playback and push domain names.
