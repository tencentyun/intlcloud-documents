In the CSS console, you can quickly configure basic features such as domain name management, live stream management, transcoding, and recording. You can also perform operations such as web push, acceleration configuration, and resource monitoring. 

## Prerequisites

- You have activated [CSS](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/css). 
- You have logged in to the [CSS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/livestat).

## Overview

Click **Overview** on the left sidebar, and you can view various data, from yesterday’s traffic fees, real-time live streaming data, the current number of push channels, the number of concurrent connections, to recent trends in billable bandwidth and traffic, as well as the number of push channels. You can also switch the billing mode or change the time granularity. You can click **Beginner's Guide** in the top-right corner to view the directions for getting started with CSS.

### Today's Data

This section displays the downstream peak bandwidth, downstream traffic usage, the current number of push channels, and the number of concurrent connections of the day.

<table>
<thead><tr><th width="20%">Statistical Item</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Current Downstream Bandwidth</td>
<td>The current downstream peak bandwidth generated by playback acceleration under all current playback domain names</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Today's Downstream Traffic</td>
<td>Today's total downstream traffic generated by playback acceleration under all playback domain names</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Current Push Channels</td>
<td>The number of current push channels</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Concurrent Connections</td>
<td><li/>If the playback protocol is RTMP or FLV, the value of **Concurrent Connections** is the number of online viewers. <li/>If the playback protocol is HLS, the value of **Concurrent Connections** does not reflect the number of online viewers.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

### Usage Trends

This section displays the live streaming usage trends for today, yesterday, last 7 days, and last 30 days, including **Bandwidth Trend**, **Traffic Trend**, and **Push Channels**.

<table>
<thead><tr><th width="20%">Statistical Item</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Bandwidth Trend</td>
<td>The total downstream peak bandwidth consumed by the acceleration service under all playback domain names in the query period</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Traffic Trend</td>
<td>The total downstream traffic consumed by the acceleration service under all playback domain names in the query period</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Push Channels</td>
<td>The number of push channels under the selected domain names in the query period</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

#### Changing time granularity

The CSS console allows you to change the time granularity when viewing the trends in billable bandwidth, traffic, and push channels by clicking the value next to **Granularity** and selecting the desired option.

### Billing Details

<table>
<thead><tr><th width="20%">Statistical Item</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Yesterday's Traffic Usage</td>
<td>This section displays the fees incurred by the downstream traffic/bandwidth generated in yesterday's live playback. You can switch between <strong>Daily bill-by-traffic</strong> and <strong>Daily bill-by-peak bandwidth</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tbody></table>

- **Switching the billing mode**
  If the current billing mode is daily billing, you can click **Switch** in **Yesterday's Traffic Usage** to switch the billing mode. Click **Confirm** in the pop-up to complete the switch.
