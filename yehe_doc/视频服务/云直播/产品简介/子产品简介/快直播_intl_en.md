## Features

#### Playback with millisecond latency
LEB uses the UDP protocol to keep the latency within 1s, much lower than 3-5s in traditional live streaming. This, along with excellent instant streaming performance and low stutter rate, guarantees a superior streaming experience.   

#### Various features and smooth migration
LEB integrates a wide range of LVB features including live push, transcoding, recording, screencapture, porn detection, and playback. It also allows smooth migration from LVB.   

#### User-friendly, secure, and reliable
You can easily integrate LEB as it uses standard protocols. You can use it for playback on Chrome and Safari without installing any plugins. Moreover, its protocols encrypt streams by default for improved security and reliability. 



## Pricing
LEB billable items include basic services and value-added services.
