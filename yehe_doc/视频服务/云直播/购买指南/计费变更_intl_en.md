## Note
- Tencent Cloud key accounts can contact sales to change billing modes.
- If you want to change your billing cycle from daily to monthly, please contact sales.
- You can switch between daily bill-by-traffic and daily bill-by-bandwidth via the console, which takes effect the following day. Switch from daily to monthly billing takes effect the following day after approval, and that from monthly to daily billing takes effect the following month after approval.
- If you switch from daily bill-by-traffic to daily bill-by-bandwidth, your traffic package can no longer be used for deduction. To use it, you need to switch back to daily bill-by-traffic.
- You can switch between daily bill-by-traffic and daily bill-by-bandwidth only once a day.
