Traffic is the accumulated value of data traffic generated when you use and access COS, including public network upstream traffic, public network downstream traffic, private network upstream traffic, private network downstream traffic, and CDN origin-pull traffic. COS charges you by the accumulated traffic usage.

## Billing Restrictions

1. ARCHIVED data cannot be read or downloaded until it is restored to the STANDARD storage class. Therefore, traffic generated from these requests is counted in the STANDARD storage class.
2. Public network downstream traffic is generated when the data is returned to COS through origin-pull by using a third-party CDN service.
3. Public network downstream traffic is generated when a user downloads objects through **object links** or browses objects through a **static website endpoint**. 
4. Cross-region replication traffic is generated when you replicate data from a bucket in one region to a bucket in another region using APIs or the cross-region replication feature. The traffic fees will vary depending on the region where the source bucket resides.
5. For INTELLIGENT TIERING, traffic fees are subject to those of the storage class after object movement.


## Traffic Generated by Using COS as CDN Origin

After you enable the CDN acceleration domain name, data downloads and access through it will incur fees:

| Billable Item | Description |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CDN origin-pull traffic | Origin-pull traffic generated by data transfer from COS to the CDN edge node when COS is used as the CDN origin. |
| CDN traffic | CDN outbound traffic generated by data download from the CDN edge node to the local system or client when COS is used as a CDN origin. |
| COS request | COS requests generated by data transfer from COS to the CDN edge node when COS is used as the CDN origin. Request fees are billed by the number of requests sent to COS. |


>? CDN traffic fees are charged by CDN. For detailed pricing, see [Pricing | Content Delivery Network](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/price/cdn?lang=en&pg=).

### Example: STANDARD storage fees + STANDARD request fees + Public downstream traffic fees

Assume that on November 1, 2020, user A uploaded a 10 GB object to a bucket residing in Guangzhou region in the STANDARD storage class, generating 100 requests, and purchased a public network downstream traffic pack of 10 GB for regions in the Chinese mainland with a validity period of one month for 1 USD. On November 2 and November 3, user A downloaded the object of 10 GB to the local file system over the public network with CDN disabled, generating 100 requests daily. Apart from these operations, user A did not perform any other operations. As storage usage, request, and traffic fees are settled daily, then:

- STANDARD storage usage fees: Settled daily starting from November 2, 2020.
- STANDARD request fees: Settled on November 2, 3, and 4, 2020.
- Traffic fees: Settled on November 3 and 4, 2020.


An analysis is performed as follows based on the two billing modes:

-  Pay-as-you-go:
- STANDARD storage usage fees = 0.024 USD/GB/month / 30 * 10 GB * 30 days = 0.24 USD
- STANDARD request fees = 0.002 USD/10,000 requests * 100 requests / 10,000 * 3 = 0.00006 USD
- Public downstream traffic fees = 0.1 USD/GB x 10 GB x 2 = 2 USD
- Traffic pack: From November 1 to November 30, 2020, 10 GB of traffic was deducted on November 3, and on November 4, as the traffic pack was used up, 10 GB of traffic was pay-as-you-go and calculated as follows: 0.1 USD/GB * 10 GB = 1 USD.

In summary, the total bill for user A in November is calculated as follows: 0.24 + 0.00006 + 1 + 1 = 2.24006 USD.
