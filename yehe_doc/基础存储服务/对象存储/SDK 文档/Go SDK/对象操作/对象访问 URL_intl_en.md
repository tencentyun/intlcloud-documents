```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/tencentyun/cos-go-sdk-v5"
    "net/http"
    "net/url"
    "os"
)

func main(){
    // Bucket name in the format of `BucketName-APPID` (`APPID` is required), which can be viewed in the COS console at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5/bucket.
    // Replace it with your region, which can be viewed in the COS console at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/. For more information about regions, visit https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6224.
    u, _ := url.Parse("https://examplebucket-1250000000.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com")
    b := &cos.BaseURL{BucketURL: u}
    client := cos.NewClient(b, &http.Client{
        Transport: &cos.AuthorizationTransport{
            // Get the key from environment variables
            // Environment variable `SECRETID` refers to the user's `SecretId`, which can be viewed in the CAM console at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi.
            SecretID: os.Getenv("SECRETID"),  // User `SecretId`. We recommend you use a sub-account key and follow the principle of least privilege to reduce risks. For information about how to obtain a sub-account key, visit https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/37140.
            // Environment variable `SECRETKEY` refers to the user's `SecretKey`, which can be viewed in the CAM console at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi.
            SecretKey: os.Getenv("SECRETKEY"),  // User `SecretKey`. We recommend you use a sub-account key and follow the principle of least privilege to reduce risks. For information about how to obtain a sub-account key, visit  https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/37140.
