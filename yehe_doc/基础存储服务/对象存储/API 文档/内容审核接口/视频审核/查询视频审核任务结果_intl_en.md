## Feature Overview

This API is used to query the result of a specified video moderation job. The video moderation feature is async. You can submit a job to moderate your video files, and then use the API for querying video moderation job result to query the moderation results.

>? Video moderation results are retained for one month, so you can query moderation results in the past month through this API.
