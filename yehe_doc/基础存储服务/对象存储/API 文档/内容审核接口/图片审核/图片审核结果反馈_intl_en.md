## Feature Description

This API is used to report moderation results that are not as expected. For example, when a pornographic image is moderated and determined as normal, or a normal image is determined as pornographic, you can directly report the result through this API.

This API will not directly modify the moderation result. The incorrect moderation result you report will be confirmed on the backend, and the confirmed result will take effect in subsequent moderation jobs.
