    "Response": {
        "Error": {
            "Code": "AuthFailure.SignatureFailure",
            "Message": "The provided credentials could not be validated. Please check your signature is correct."
        },
        "RequestId": "ed93f3cb-f35e-473f-b9f3-0d451b8b79c6"
    }
}
```

Code in Error indicates the error code, while Message indicates the specific information of the error.
