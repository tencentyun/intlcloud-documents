## Event Overview
An event is an information carrier, which describes a non-sustainable change to a specific object at a specific time. An event is associated with a unique moment and a unique object. For example, an event occurs when the status of a computer changes from running to shutdown, when a program starts or stops to run, or when a power failure occurs in an office building. An event records the moment when an object changes between different states.

The monitoring service is designed to help find, locate and solve problems, ensuring the overall stability and performance of the system and services. **Information and data** are core drivers for OPS and monitoring.

As the main information source for monitoring, the metric describes the value and trend of an object’s specific variable over time in a threshold–like, periodic and persistent manner. Thus, the metric shows the usage of resources and the environment, and reflects their health states. For example, the metric can show the CPU utilization of a Cloud Virtual Machine (CVM) and the slow log quantity of a database instance.
The metric covers most scenarios where problems are detected during monitoring. But using only the metric as the information source for monitoring has the following disadvantages:
- Information transmission delay. The threshold for a metric may or may not change after an event occurs for a time period.
- The accuracy and clarity of the transmitted information are low. It is difficult to judge and locate the real event or the cause of the problem by analyzing changes in threshold alone.
- Information carrier forms are limited. Metric is recorded in the form of thresholds, with no other text-based supplementary and incidental information provided.


An event is introduced as a carrier of monitoring information and can describe the running status of **resources** and **underlying infrastructure and services** in a more accurate and direct manner, helping to discover, locate and solve problems more efficiently.
**Advantage:** Events are result-oriented and can improve the accuracy of information, reduce delay, transmit more information, and enrich the dimension of monitoring information.

## Event center introduction
As the event information hub of Tencent Cloud, the Cloud Monitor (CM) event center packages important event information in the lifecycle and operation of Tencent Cloud **resources** and **underlying infrastructure and services** into a product, and constructs a complete event consumption channel and process to support cloud monitoring and OPS for customers.

Tencent Cloud product modules and underlying infrastructure services obtain the packaged event information provided by the event center, and then integrate, determine, condense and ultimately present it. Information sources are system logs and monitoring items under each module, ensuring the accuracy and value of the information passed on to customers.

## Event Types
Based on information sources, causes, characteristics and forms, events are categorized by the event center as product events and platform events, while carried by two independent product pages and consumption processes.
- [**Product Event:**](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/14362) Product events arise from resource instances and products (such as CVM instances) that are purchased and used by a customer on Tencent Cloud. These events are directly or indirectly triggered by the customer’s use of these products. These events belong to specific resource instances. The customer can control and handle the events, and resource instances affected by and associated with events can be explicitly determined.
- [**Platform Event:**](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/14364) Platform events are generated by the underlying infrastructure and services that support Tencent Cloud products, such as Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) that supports the CVM products at the virtualization layer and the underlying physical machines, networks, and storage modules. These events are generated or caused by the infrastructure and services of Tencent Cloud, and are not the result of customer behavior. These events belong to services. The customer cannot control the events, which instead can only be handled by Tencent Cloud. Services or product modules affected by and associated with events can be determined, but the affected and associated resource instances cannot always be determined.

**Event comparison**

| Item | Product Event | Platform Event |
| -------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Event source | Resource instances and products purchased and used by customers on Tencent Cloud | Underlying infrastructure and services of Tencent Cloud |
| Event cause | Directly or indirectly caused by customers’ use of products or resource instances | Generated or caused by the underlying infrastructure and services of Tencent Cloud |
| Event dimension | Resource instances | Underlying services |
| Event handling | Customers can control and handle events | Customers cannot control events, which can only be handled by Tencent Cloud |
| Event objects | Resource instances affected by and associated with events can be explicitly determined | Underlying services or product modules affected by and associated with events can be determined, but resource instances affected by events cannot always be determined |


## Event Center Case

According to event information, the event center plans and provides comprehensive event consumption channels and capabilities.

![Event Center Case](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/07e6540c12a045232174cdf3646e91ff/image.png)

- Display and rewind: records all event information related to the account. In the console, users can view, globally filter, search for, and rewind event information.
- Alarm and notification: configures alarms or subscriptions for monitored events and resources to promptly notify the people in charge.
- Data pulled by APIs: uses APIs to pull event information and connect it to Tencent’s monitoring system.
- Automation: uses events as sources to trigger associated calls to support automatic OPS for customers.

## Value
- Provides a wider range of resource monitoring information on Tencent Cloud to offer comprehensive data support for monitoring and OPS.
- Provides channels for event information consumption to help convert monitoring data into valuable information.
- Converges determination logic to locate the affected resources and their causes in a more efficient and direct manner.
- Event information can be traced and reviewed to understand important event changes in resources and platform lifecycles.
- Events can be used as triggers to automatically respond to specific resource and environment changes.
