## Operation Scenario
This document describes how to create a TcaplusDB cluster in the console.

## Prerequisites
You have [signed up for a Tencent Cloud account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/9603) and [verified your identity successfully](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/3629).

## Directions
1. Log in to the [TcaplusDB Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tcaplusdb/app), select **Table Group** on the left sidebar, and click **Create Cluster**.
2. Configure your cluster in the cluster creation pop-up.
 - **Network Type**: Select a VPC and a subnet. You can select one VPC and one subnet only when creating a cluster, which cannot be modified once created.
 - **Connection Protocol**: Select a connection protocol (data description protocol) for your TcaplusDB cluster.
 - **Cluster Name and Access Password**: A cluster name should be unique under the same account. An access password must contain lowercase letters (a-z), uppercase letters (A-Z), and digits (0-9).
