## Scenario
TencentDB for Redis supports assigning instances to different projects for easier management. Assigned instances can be reassigned to other projects.
>
>- Read-only instances and disaster recovery instances are associated instances of the master instance and should be in the same project as the master instance.
>- Assigning and moving database instances across projects will not affect the services provided by the instances.


## Directions
1. Log in to the [Redis Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/redis).
2. Select the instance to be assigned in the instance list and click **Assign to a Project**.
