## License Included
Tencent Cloud offers TencentDB instances with **license included**. The price of a **license included** model includes a SQL Server software license, underlying hardware resources and TencentDB management functions, so there is no need to purchase a Microsoft SQL Server license separately.

You only need to pay for instance specifications and usage duration, and don’t have to worry about hardware and licensing costs when using a "license included" database. You can cut IT costs by only paying low variable costs instead of high fixed costs.


>!- Purchasing TencentDB for SQL Server does not mean that you purchased a Microsoft SQL Server long-term license contract; therefore, you should not use the TencentDB license outside of this service. For more information, see [Microsoft Volume Licensing Product Terms and Online Services Terms](http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/ProductResults.aspx?doc=Product%20Terms,OST&fid=20).
>- The basic price of TencentDB for SQL Server **does not include** other Microsoft or Tencent Cloud services.
