## Operation Scenario
Tencent Kubernetes Engine (TKE) is a highly scalable high-performance container management service allowing you to easily run applications on hosted CVM instance clusters. In this tutorial, you will understand how to use TKE to quickly create and manage container clusters and how to quickly and flexibly deploy your services in the clusters.    

## Steps
### Creating a Cluster
At first, you need to create a cluster. A cluster refers to the collection of cloud resources required by container operation, including several CVM instances, load balancers, and other Tencent Cloud resources.
1. Log in to the [Tencent Cloud TKE console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2) and click **Clusters** in the left sidebar.
2. Click **Create** above the list of clusters in the **Cluster Management** page. See the figure below:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/657fdbd2086f82130ca5ee3464ad27b7.png)
3. Set the basic information for the cluster on the **Create Cluster** page and click **Next**. See the figure below:
 - **Cluster Name**: The name of a cluster to create, with a length limited to 60 characters.
 - **Project of New-added Resource**: Select based on actual needs. Newly added resources will be automatically assigned to this project.
 - **Kubernetes Version**: Multiple Kubernetes versions are provided for your choice. Click [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/supported-doc-versions/) to view feature differences of the versions.
 - **Runtime Component**: Choose “docker” or “containerd”. For more details, see [Differences Between Containerd and Docker](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/31088).
 - **Region**: Select the closest region based on your location. This helps minimize access latency and improve download speed.
 - **Cluster Network**: Assigns an IP address that is within the node’s network address range to the CVMs in the cluster. For details, see [Container and Node Network Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/9083).
 - **Container Network**: Assigns an IP address that is within the container’s network address range to the containers in the cluster. For details, see [Container and Node Network Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/9083).
 - **Image Provider**: To be selected based on your requirements.
 - **Operating System**: To be selected based on your requirements.
 - **Cluster description**: Enter the information about the cluster, which will be displayed on the **Cluster Information** page.
 - **Advanced Settings**: You can set IPVS.
 IPVS is suitable for scenarios where large-scale services are run on a cluster, and it  cannot be disabled once enabled. For more information, see [Enabling IPVS in a Cluster](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/30641).

4. Select the model and click **Next**. See the figure below:
 - **Create Cluster**: To be selected based on your requirements.
 - **Master**: The deployment method of “Master” determines the management mode for your cluster. There are two cluster modes, “fully-managed” and “self-managed”. For more details, see [Cluster Types](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/30635#cluster-type).
 - **Node**: Configures the worker node that is actually used by the cluster to run services. You can purchase a CVM as the **Node** when you create the cluster, or you can add the **Node** after the cluster has been created.
 - **Billing method**: This provides the Pay as you go billing mode. For more details, please see [Billing Method](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2180).
 - **Node Model**: This can be selected when **Node** is selected as **Add**. You can select an existing CVM as the **Node** and you can also add a **Node** after the cluster is created.

5. Enter the CVM configuration and click **Next**. See the figure below:
 - **Data disk mounting**: Check this based on your own requirements. After checking it, the following operations will occur:
    - The data disk will automatically be mounted to the mount point you designated and will be automatically formatted to the ext4 file system format. 
    - The container will be saved to the container directory of the mount point. 
    - This option is only valid for nodes that have one data disk.
 - **Security group**: The security group works as a firewall to control network access of the CVM. For more information, see [TKE Security Group Settings](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/9084).
 - **Login method**: Three login methods are available.
    - **Custom Password**: Set a corresponding password as prompted.
    - **SSH Key Pair**: A key pair is a pair of parameters generated by an algorithm. It is a way to log in to a CVM instance that is more secure than regular passwords. For more details, see [SSH Key](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/6092).
    - **Random Password**: A password will be automatically generated and sent to you through internal message.
 - **Auto adjustment**: A scaling group with a maximum of two nodes can be created automatically.
