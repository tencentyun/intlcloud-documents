1. Log in to [Tencent Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/) and choose **Products** > **Virtual Private Cloud* to open the VPC console. Then, click **NAT Gateway** in the left sidebar.
2. In the list, click the ID of the NAT gateway to be modified to go to its details page, where you can perform the following operations.
