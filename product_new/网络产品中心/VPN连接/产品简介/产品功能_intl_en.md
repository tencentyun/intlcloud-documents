## VPN Gateway Monitoring and Control

- VPN Gateway Traffic Monitoring and Control provides the **monitoring** and **controlling** capabilities at IP-gateway granularity. The refined gateway traffic visualization enables network OPS personnel to get a clear picture of the traffic in the gateway. In addition, the speed limiting capability at IP-gateway granularity helps to block abnormal traffic. 
The advantages of gateway traffic throttling are as follows:
 - With the capability for accurate gateway troubleshooting, it can minimize network downtime. It can also analyze the source IP address and its key metrics by using the real-time traffic query and the TOP N ranking feature, to rapidly locate abnormal traffic.
 - With the **monitoring** and **control** capabilities at IP-gateway granularity and by using minute-level network traffic query, it can identify abnormal traffic that maliciously consumes the bandwidth in real time, and set bandwidth limits at IP-gateway granularity to ensure the stable operation of core businesses.
 - It has a full-time and full-traffic gateway traffic analysis capability, to help minimize cloud network costs. By means of QoS, it can limit the bandwidth of non-key businesses to minimize costs for limited network budgets.
- For example, in an early morning, the gateway traffic of an enterprise surges. With intelligent gateway traffic control, the OPS personnel can trace data to find which IP addresses caused this traffic surge according to the time when the traffic surge occurred, so as to rapidly locate its source. In addition, the gateway traffic control feature provides bandwidth control at IP-gateway granularity, which can restrict the bandwidth from an IP address to the gateway and block abnormal traffic to safeguard key businesses.

## Traffic Alarms

Custom traffic alarms can be set up to enable advance alerting for risks, with alarm messages automatically sent via emails and SMS messages when a metric exceeds its threshold. Both the monitoring and alarm functions are free of charge, enabling you to quickly locate problems once they occur.
