Currently, cross-region Classiclink supports only communication between CVMs, but does not support communication between a CVM and other Tencent Cloud resource (such as a database). 
A VPC is strongly recommended for cross-region conmmunication. If you still need to use cross-region Classiclink, please [submit a ticket](https://cloud.tencent.com/login?s_url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.cloud.tencent.com%2Fworkorder%2Fcategory%2Fcreate%3Flevel1_id%3D6%26level2_id%3D168%26level1_name%3D%25E8%25AE%25A1%25E7%25AE%2597%25E4%25B8%258E%25E7%25BD%2591%25E7%25BB%259C%26level2_name%3D%25E7%25A7%2581%25E6%259C%2589%25E7%25BD%2591%25E7%25BB%259C%2520VPC).
