### What is an MFA device?
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a simple and effective security authentication method. It adds an additional layer of protection to strengthen the user name and password credentials. An MFA device, also called a dynamic password card or token, is a device that provides this type of secure authentication method. Tencent Cloud currently offers two types of MFA devices: hardware MFA devices and virtual MFA devices.
