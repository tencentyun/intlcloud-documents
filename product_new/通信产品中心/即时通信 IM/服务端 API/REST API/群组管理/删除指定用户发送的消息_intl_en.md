## Feature Description
This API is used to delete messages sent by a specified user from the last 1,000 messages.

## API Invocation Description
### Applicable group types

| Group Type | Support This RESTful API |
|-----------|------------|
| Private | Yes |
| Public | Yes |
| ChatRoom | Yes |
| AVChatRoom | No (see description below) |
| BChatRoom | No (see description below) |

IM supports the preceding five types of groups. For details, see [Group Systems](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/269/1502).

> AVChatRoom and BChatRoom groups do not store roaming messages (here, the deleted messages refer to roaming messages.) For both types of groups, the deletion of user messages is ineffective (although no error will be returned). In a BChatRoom group, only the app admin can send messages, whereas ordinary users cannot.

## Error Codes

Unless a network error (such as error 502) occurs, the HTTP return code for this API is always 200. ErrorCode and ErrorInfo in the response packet represent the actual error code and error information, respectively.
For common error codes (60000 to 79999), see [Error Codes](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/269/1671).
The following table describes the error codes specific to this API.

| Error Code | Description |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 10002 | An internal server error occurred. In this case, try again. |
| 10003 | A request command keyword is invalid. |
| 10004 | A request parameter is invalid. In this case, check whether request parameters are correct based on the error description. |
| 10007 | Operation permissions are insufficient. For example, an ordinary member in a public group attempts to remove a member from the group, but only the app admin has the permission to do so. |
| 10010 | The group does not exist or has been dismissed. |
| 10015 | The group ID is invalid. In this case, check whether the group ID is correct. |
