## Feature Description
 This API can be used by the app admin to obtain group member information based on the group ID.

## API Commissioning Tool
Use the [online commissioning tool for RESTful APIs](https://avc.cloud.tencent.com/im/APITester/APITester.html#v4/group_open_http_svc/get_group_member_info) to commission this API.

## API Calling Description
### Applicable group types

| Group Type | Support This RESTful API |
|-----------|------------|
| Private | Yes |
| Public | Yes |
| ChatRoom | Yes |
| AVChatRoom | Yes for no more than 300 members (see description below) |
| BChatRoom | No (see description below) |

Instant Messaging (IM) provides the preceding five built-in group types. For details, see [Group Systems](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529).

> Due to differences in internal implementation, if the group type is AVChatRoom, information can be obtained only for up to 300 group members. For members who joined the group after the number of members reached 300, their information cannot be obtained. If the group type is BChatRoom, no group member information can be obtained.

### Request URL example
```
https://console.tim.qq.com/v4/group_open_http_svc/get_group_member_info?sdkappid=88888888&identifier=admin&usersig=xxx&random=99999999&contenttype=json
```
### Request parameters

The following table lists only the parameters to be modified when this API is called. For details on other parameters, see [RESTful API Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34620).

| Parameter | Description |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| v4/group_open_http_svc/get_group_member_info | The request API. |
| sdkappid | The SDKAppID assigned by the IM console when an app is created. |

### Maximum calling frequency
The maximum calling frequency is 200 times per second.
### Request packet examples

- **Basic form**
Obtains detailed group member information, including group member profiles and the custom fields of group members. The request contains only the group ID.
```
{
    "GroupId":"@TGS#1NVTZEAE4"  // Group ID (required)
}
```
- **Pulling by page**
You can use the Limit and Offset fields to control pagination pulling:
 - The Limit field specifies the maximum number of members in the MemberList array in the response packet, which cannot exceed 6,000.
 - The Offset field specifies the sequence number of the starting group member for information pulling. For a pagination request (the page number starts from 1), the Offset value of each page is calculated as follows: `(Page number – 1) × Number of group members displayed on each page`.
 For example, if pagination pulling is requested and 20 group members are displayed on each page, request parameters for the first page are `{"Limit" : 20, "Offset" : 0}`, whereas those for the second page are `{"Limit" : 20, "Offset" : 20}`, and so on.

 The value of Limit or Offset does not affect TotalCount in the response packet. 
```
{
    "GroupId":"@TGS#1NVTZEAE4", // Group ID (required)
    "Limit": 100, // Maximum number of members whose information to be pulled
    "Offset": 0 // Sequence number of the starting group member whose information to be pulled
}
```
- **Specifying information to be pulled**
You can use the MemberInfoFilter field to specify fields that you want to pull. Fields not specified in MemberInfoFilter will not be pulled.
```
{
    "GroupId":"@TGS#1NVTZEAE4", // Group ID (required)
    "MemberInfoFilter": [ // Specifies the information to be obtained, where Member_Account is included by default. If this field is not specified, all group member information will be pulled.
        "Role",
        "JoinTime",
        "MsgSeq",
        "MsgFlag",
        "LastSendMsgTime",
        "ShutUpUntil",
        "NameCard"
    ]
}
```
- **Pulling the information of members with a specified role**
You can use the MemberRoleFilter field to specify the role of members whose information to be pulled. If this field is not specified, the information of members with any roles will be pulled.
```
{
    "GroupId":"@TGS#37AB3PAEC", // Group ID (required)
    "MemberRoleFilter":[ // Member role filter
        "Owner",
        "Member"
    ]
}
```
- **Pulling the custom fields of a group member**
You can use the AppDefinedDataFilter_GroupMember field to specify the custom fields of group members to be pulled. Fields that are not specified in AppDefinedDataFilter_GroupMember will be ignored.
```
{
    "GroupId":"@TGS#37AB3PAEC", // Group ID (required)
    "AppDefinedDataFilter_GroupMember": [ // Custom field filter for group members
        "MemberDefined2" // Key of the custom field
    ]
}
```
- **ALL IN ONE**
```
{
    "GroupId":"@TGS#1NVTZEAE4", // Group ID (required)
    "MemberInfoFilter": [ // Specifies the information to be obtained. If this field is not specified, all group member information will be pulled.
        "Role",
        "JoinTime",
        "MsgSeq",
        "MsgFlag",
        "LastSendMsgTime",
        "ShutUpUntil",
        "NameCard"
    ],
   "MemberRoleFilter":[ // Member role filter
        "Owner",
        "Member"
    ],
   "AppDefinedDataFilter_GroupMember": [ // Custom field filter for group members
        "MemberDefined2", // Key of the custom field
        "MemberDefined1"
    ],
    "Limit": 100, // Maximum number of members whose information to be pulled
    "Offset": 0 // Sequence number of the starting group member whose information to be pulled
}
```

### Response packet fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
| ActionStatus | String | The request processing result. OK: succeeded. FAIL: failed. |
| ErrorCode | Integer | The error code. 0: succeeded. Other values: failed. |
| ErrorInfo | String | Error information. |
| MemberNum | Integer | The total number of members in the group. |
| MemberList | Array | The list of obtained group members, which contains the information of all or specified group members. For details on group member information fields, see [Group Member Profiles](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529#.E7.BE.A4.E6.88.90.E5.91.98.E8.B5.84.E6.96.99). |
| AppMemberDefinedData | Array | Returned member custom fields. |

## Error Codes

Unless a network error (such as error 502) occurs, the HTTP return code for this API is always 200. ErrorCode and ErrorInfo in the response packet represent the actual error code and error information, respectively.
For common error codes (60000 to 79999), see [Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34348).
The following table describes the error codes specific to this API.

| Error Code | Description |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 10002 | An internal server error occurred. To correct it, try again. |
| 10003 | The request command word is invalid. |
| 10004 | A parameter is invalid. To correct it, check whether request parameters are correct based on the error description. |
| 10007 | The operator dose not have sufficient permissions for this operation. To correct it, check whether the operator is the app admin or whether the operator has the permission to read fields in the request. |
| 10010 | The group does not exist or has been dismissed. |
| 10015 | The group ID is invalid. To correct it, check whether the group ID is correct. |
| 10018 | The response packet length exceeds the maximum packet length (1 MB). The amount of group member data is too large. To correct it, use the Limit and Offset fields to pull group member information by page. |
