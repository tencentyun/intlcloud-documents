## 1. Terms and Definitions

**1.1  Tencent Cloud Workload Protection Service:** means the product features (both basic edition and professional edition) provided by Cloud Workload Protection. The Service Availability of professional edition is no less than 99% while the basic edition is free to use with no guarantee of Service level. For details, please refer to the Service you purchase and the contents of the Service provided by Tencent Cloud. 

**1.2  Service Unavailability:** The failure or malfunction of the security function caused by the abnormality of the Cloud Workload Protection Service system (for example, the security feature cannot be used, and the product cannot be started or uninstalled).

**1.3  Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes:** Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes = the time when the Service Unavailability of the Service is fixed – the time when the Service Unavailability of the Service starts. Such downtime will be calculated in minutes, and when the downtime, or an unrounded portion thereof, is less than sixty (60) seconds, it will be rounded up to one (1) minute. For example, if the actual downtime is one (1) minute and one (1) second, the Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes is two (2) minutes. If the Service Unavailability of the Service is fixed within one (1) minute, which means that the actual downtime of the Service is less than one (1) minute, such downtime will not be counted towards the Service Downtime.

**1.4  Service Month(s):** means the calendar month(s) within the term of the Service purchased by you. For example, if you purchase the Service for a term of three months starting from March 17, there will be four (4) Service Months (the first Service Month from March 17 to March 31, the second from April 1 to April 30, the third from May 1 to May 31, and the fourth from June 1 to June 16). The availability of the Service will be calculated independently for each Service Month.

## 2. Service Availability

#### 2.1  **Calculation of Service Availability**

Service Availability = ((total time of a Service Month calculated in minutes - Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes within a Service Month) / total time of a Service Month calculated in minutes) × 100%

#### 2.2  **Service Availability Standard**

**The Service Availability of the Service provided by Tencent Cloud will be** **no less than** **99%**. You are entitled to the compensation as set forth in Section 3 below if the Service Availability fails to meet the aforementioned standard, other than in any circumstance as provided for in the release of liabilities provisions below. 

## 3.  Service Compensation

 In respect of this Service, if the Service Availability fails to meet the abovementioned standard, you will be entitled to compensations in accordance with the following terms:

#### 3.1  **Standards of Compensation**

  (1) Compensations will be made **in the form of voucher** by Tencent Cloud, and you should follow the rules for using the voucher (including the valid term; for details, please refer to the rules of vouchers published on Tencent Cloud’s official website). You cannot redeem such voucher for cash or request to issue an invoice for such voucher. Such voucher can only be used to purchase the Service by using your Tencent Cloud account. You cannot use the voucher to purchase other services of Tencent Cloud, nor should you give the voucher to a third party for consideration or for free.

  (2) If the Service Availability for a Service Month fails to meet the standard, the amount of compensation will be calculated for such month independently, and **the aggregate amount shall be no more than the applicable monthly Service fee paid by you for such month** (the monthly Service fee referred to herein shall exclude the fee deducted by a voucher or promotional coupon, Service fee discounted or waived, or fees otherwise deductible). **This section only** **applies to users of the professional edition of** **Cloud Workload Protection****.** **Users of the free basic** **edition are not entitled to the compensation specified herein, and the calculation of compensation therefor is based on the number of affected devices.**

| Service   Availability (Av) for a Service Month | Value   of Compensation Voucher |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 99% > Av ≥ 90%                                              | 10% of the monthly Service fee      |
| 90% > Av ≥ 80%                                              | 25% of the monthly Service fee      |
| 80% > Av                                                    | 100% of the monthly Service fee     |

 

#### 3.2  **Time Limit for Compensation Application**

  (1) If the Service Availability for a Service Month fails to meet the abovementioned Service Availability standard, you may apply for compensation **through (and only through) the support ticket system under your relevant account** after the fifth (5th) business day of the month immediately following such Service Month. Tencent Cloud will verify and ascertain your application upon receipt of such application. If there is any dispute over the calculation of the Service Availability for a Service Month, **both parties agree that the back-end record of Tencent Cloud will prevail**.

  (2) **You should apply for such compensation no later than sixty (60) calendar days following the expiry of the applicable Service Month in which the Service Availability fails to meet the standard**.
