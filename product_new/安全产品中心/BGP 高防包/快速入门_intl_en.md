Anti-DDoS Pro provides Tencent Cloud public IP with higher anti-DDoS capability. It supports Tencent Cloud services like CVM, CLB, NAT, and WAF. Accessing Anti-DDoS Pro is convenient. It requires no change of business IP, and allows for fast protection configuration.
Currently, Anti-DDoS Pro provides two types of instances, Single IP instance and the Multi-IP instance.
## Prerequisites
Before you bind the protected IP, you need to successfully [purchase an Anti-DDoS Pro instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1029/31748).
