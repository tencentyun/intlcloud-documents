**Billing description:**

1. Billable items: audio call, SD video call, HD video call, and FHD video call.

2. Billing mode: pay-as-you-go.

3. Billing cycle: the service is charged on a monthly basis during the 1st to 5th days the next month.

4. Billing rules: the service is charged by multiplying the transcoding duration of different codecs and resolutions on a calendar day by the corresponding unit price.

5. Billing example:

   Assume that you created a TRTC application on January 1, 2020. In January, the total durations of audio calls, SD video calls, HD video calls, and FHD video calls were 10,000 minutes, respectively.

   Audio call fees = (10000/1000) thousand minutes * 0.99 USD/thousand minutes = 9.9 USD

   SD video call fees = (10000/1000) thousand minutes * 1.99 USD/thousand minutes = 19.9 USD

   HD video call fees = (10000/1000) thousand minutes * 3.99 USD/thousand minutes = 39.9 USD

   FHD video call fees = (10000/1000) thousand minutes * 14.99 USD/thousand minutes = 149.9 USD

   Total fees = audio call fees + SD video call fees + HD video call fees + FHD video call fees = 9.9 USD + 19.9 USD + 39.9 USD + 149.9 USD = 219.6 USD

   > Note:
   >
   > - In each billable item of TRTC, a duration below 1 minute will be calculated as 1 minute; for example, an audio call duration of 1,000.5 minutes will be calculated as 1,001 minutes for billing.
