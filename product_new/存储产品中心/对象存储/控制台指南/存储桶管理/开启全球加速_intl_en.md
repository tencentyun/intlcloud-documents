## Overview

You can enable global acceleration for your bucket in the COS Console, so that end users around the globe can quickly access your bucket, which improves your business access success rate and business stability.
## Directions

1. Log in to the [COS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5), click **Bucket List** on the left sidebar, and select the bucket for which you want to configure global acceleration to enter the bucket details page.

4. After enabling global acceleration, you can quickly access the bucket using a global acceleration domain name in the format of `<BucketName-APPID>.cos.accelerate.myqcloud.com`.
>Enabling global acceleration will not affect the existing default bucket domain name. You can still use them.
