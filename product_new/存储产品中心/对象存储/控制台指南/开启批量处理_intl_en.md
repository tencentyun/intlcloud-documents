## Overview

The batch operation feature of COS allows you to manipulate objects in a bucket in batches. Currently, you can perform the following batch operations:

- Replicating objects

You can put the needed objects in an inventory file, which can come from the inventory report generated by the inventory feature (you need to [enable the inventory feature](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30624) first) or be created in the specified format on your own. The batch operation feature can operate on the objects in batches based on this inventory file. For more information, please see [Batch Operation Overview](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/38601).

## Directions

1. Log in to the [COS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5) and click **Batch Operation** on the left sidebar to enter the batch operation job management page.
2. Click **Create Job** to start creating a batch operation job. The main configuration items are described as follows.
 - **Job Region**: Select a region for the job to be created. The task region should be the same as the bucket region where the objects pending operations in your inventory reside; otherwise, the job would fail. **The Chengdu and Chongqing regions are currently in beta test.**
 - **Inventory Format**: Select a format for the inventory objects as needed. There are two formats:
<table>
   <tr>
      <th>Inventory Format</th>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Configuration Instructions</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td nowrap="nowrap">COS inventory report</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>Please select this format if the inventory file comes from an inventory report generated by the inventory feature</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td rowspan="4">CSV</td>
      <td>Ignore</td>
      <td>Placeholder field, which can be used when your inventory file contains irregular fields</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Bucket</td>
      <td>Bucket name</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Key</td>
      <td>Name of an object in a bucket. If CSV file format is used, the object name is URL-encoded and must be decoded before it can be used</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>VersionId</td>
      <td>Object version ID. If versioning is enabled for the bucket, COS assigns a version number to the objects added to the bucket. If you want to use an object version other than the latest version, you can select a version ID that contains an inventory object</td>
   </tr>
</table>
 - **Inventory Bucket**: Select the bucket where the inventory is stored.
 - **Inventory File Path**: Enter the inventory file or CSV file path in the format of `directory/manifest.json` or `directory/manifest.csv`, respectively. For example, if you have an inventory stored in the `examplebucket-1250000000` root directory, the inventory path will be `manifest.json`.

3. Click **Next** and the inventory ETag will be displayed, reflecting that you have selected the correct inventory objects. Then, you will enter the operation configuration page.
	- **Job Type**: Select the type of operation you want to perform on all the objects in the inventory list.
	- **Destination Bucket**: Select the bucket where to store the replicas of the objects in the inventory list.
	- **Storage Type**: Standard or Standard_IA.
	- **Server-side Encryption**: Select whether to encrypt the object replicas. Options include no encryption or SSE-COS encryption.
	- **Access Permission**: Set access permissions to the object replicas. Options include inheriting destination bucket's permission, private read/write, and public read/private write.
	- **Object Metadata**: Set metadata for the object copies. You can choose to copy the original metadata or replace all metadata.
