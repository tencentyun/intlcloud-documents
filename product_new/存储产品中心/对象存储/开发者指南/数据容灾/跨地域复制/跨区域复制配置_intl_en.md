## Applicable Scenarios
With cross-region replication enabled, object data in your source bucket can be copied to the designated destination bucket in another region. Cross-region replication can help you achieve remote disaster recovery, comply with industry-specific requirements, migrate and back up data, reduce access latency, enable clusters in different regions to access data, etc.

## Directions

### Configuring via the COS Console
For information on how to configure a cross-region replication rule in the COS Console, see [Setting Cross-region Replication](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/19235) documentation.

### Configuring via REST API
You can configure and manage cross-region replication via REST API as described in the following API documentation:

- [PUT Bucket replication](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/19223) 
- [GET Bucket replication](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/19222) 
- [DELETE Bucket replication](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/19221)
