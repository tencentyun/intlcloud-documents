## Optimized Architecture
In order to provide more robust and stable IoT platform service, the system has been reconstructed after thorough integration. The [old console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/iot) is still available, but its features will no longer be updated. Plus, its resources and data are isolated from the new system.

## Updated Device SDK
- The underlying layer supports message deduplication (configurable)
- For the MQTT protocol, the QOS=1 message is published in an async manner to improve the communication efficiency.
- The device SDK is connected to the updated domain name for accessing the new system
- The CoAP protocol is supported
- The Android SDK is supported

## Cloud Log
Key information is logged for the main scenario nodes and online/offline switching behaviors of the device message linkage, so you can analyze the device behaviors based on the logs for troubleshooting.

## Device Communication
In order to better meet your needs in different application scenarios, the product's default topic permissions are changed to ${productId}/${deviceName}/event (permission for publishing) and ${productId}/${deviceName}/control (permission for subscription). For details, see [here](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/634/11915).

## Cloud API 
- Cloud API's access domain name is changed to iotcloud.api.qcloud.com for accessing the new system
- The productId concept is introduced, and the Cloud API parameters use productId + deviceName as the device's unique identifier. For details, see [here](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/634/12056).
