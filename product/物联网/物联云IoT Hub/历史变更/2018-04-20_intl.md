### List of Functions Supported by Rule Engine
In the data processing part of the rule engine, SQL-like statements can be written to filter the data in the topic and then forward the data to the third-party components or send it to other devices.
For details, see ["List of Functions supported by Rule Engine"](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/634/16485).

### Data Forward to CTSDB
The rule engine allows you to configure rules to forward the eligible device-reported data to the CTSDB time series database, and then your application server can read the data from CTSDB for processing. This takes advantage of CTSDB's high storage compression rate and aggregated display for massive amounts of data, effectively meeting the daily needs of devices for data storage, analytics and visual display.
