If you do not pass the verification when you choose to manually verify the DNS, you can troubleshoot the problem through self-diagnosis:

### 1. Check whether the domain name status is normal
Make sure the domain name can be properly resolved. For domain names without identity verification, domain names just purchased, etc., the resolution may fail.

### 2. Check the DNS Server
Make sure you have added the resolution at the correct resolution service provider. For example, if DNS server is a Wanwang server, it will not work to add TXT resolution in Tencent cloud DNS.

### 3. Check resolution records
With the domain name properly resolved and the resolution added in the correct DNS provider, if you still do not pass the verification, the host, record values and so on may be mistakenly entered. If the TXT records are added completely and accurately, please wait for 24 hours.

If you still do not pass the verification 24 hours later, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) to ask Tencent Cloud engineers for assistance.
