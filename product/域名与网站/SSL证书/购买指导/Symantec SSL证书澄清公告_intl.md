"Google No Longer Trusts Symantec Certificates" spreading recently on the Internet is fake news which does not correspond to the actual situation. We hereby clarify that:

1. Symantec PKI system for issuing SSL Certificates will undergo a security upgrade. In order to urge Symantec to update, Google plans to distrust **certificates issued by non-updated Symantec PKI system** instead of all Symantec SSL certificates since October 23, 2018 when Chrome70 will be released. The fake news above is a serious misinterpretation.  
2. Symantec plans to enable the new PKI system on December 1, 2017. SSL certificates that are issued prior to December 1, 2017 by the non-updated PKI system and will expire after October 23, 2018 will be reissued to users for free. Therefore, Symantec's PKI system update is absolutely safe and will not affect users.  
3. It is also a rumor without any official response that Symantec is selling the CA certificate business.    

Stay tuned for the upcoming detailed official clarification from Symantec. Please do not be misled by fake news and feel free to purchase Symantec SSL Certificates.
