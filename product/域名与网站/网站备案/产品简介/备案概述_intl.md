## Why is ICP Filing Necessary

Pursuant to China's State Council Decree No. 292 "Administrative Measures for Internet Information Services" and China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Order No. 33 "Measures for the Administration of the Filing of Non-operational Internet Information Services", China implements a licensing system for operational internet information services and filing system for non-operational internet information services. Any Internet information services provided before obtaining the license or filing would be deemed illegal.

Therefore, ICP filing is mandatory for mainland China server usage, and websites can be launched and accessed only after obtaining ICP filing number from communications administrations.

ICP filing number is in accordance with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) official website: [website for query](http://www.miitbeian.gov.cn/publish/query/indexFirst.action)
For more information about applicable laws and regulations, see [Laws and Regulations](http://www.miitbeian.gov.cn/state/outPortal/moreCodex.action?fileDownLoadInfo.fileType=0).

### Impact of No ICP Filing

If your website's domain name does not have the ICP filing and is resolved to Tencent Cloud servers, Tencent Cloud will block access and redirect visitors to a standard page reminding you to complete ICP filing. If you need to set up a website, please complete the ICP filing application process before launching the website.

If your domain name has an ICP filing number that is not obtained via Tencent Cloud, and your server needs to migrate or has already migrated to Tencent Cloud, you will need to transfer your ICP filing to us. If your website has not obtained an ICP filing via Tencent Cloud and is resolved to our servers, Tencent Cloud will block access and redirect visitors to a standard page. For details, see [ICP Filing Transfer Application](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/243/19024).


### ICP Filing Exemption for Servers Outside Mainland China

ICP filing is not required if you purchase servers located in Hong Kong or foreign countries, as ICP filing is only applicable for IP addresses in mainland China.

## ICP Filing Application by Organization Outside Mainland China

Currently, organizations outside mainland China cannot apply ICP filing. These organizations have to set up a mainland China branch and obtain state-approved organization documents to file ICP. Organizations outside mainland China may consider purchasing servers located in Hong Kong, China, where ICP filing is not needed.

## Types of ICP Filing Available via Tencent Cloud

- Operational websites operating in mainland China need to apply for an value-added telecommunications business license for internet information services (i.e., ICP license). To apply for an ICP license, you must first have a valid ICP filing number. You should apply for the operational ICP license at **the local communications administration**.  For detailed requirements, visit the local website for operational ICP license application.
- Non-operational websites operating in mainland China shall apply for an ICP filing with their local communications administration or the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Tencent Cloud supports the following ICP filing application types:

## ICP Filing Number

After the ICP filing is successfully obtained, the communications administration will assign an entity ICP filing number to the ICP filing entity (which can be either an individual or organization) and assign a website ICP filing number to the website.
**Entity ICP filing number** format: Province name + ICP filing + entity's serial number
**Website ICP filing number** format: Province name + ICP filing + entity's serial number - website's serial number

#### Examples

The website ICP filing number of Tencent Cloud's official website (cloud.tencent.com) is Beijing ICP Filing No. 11018762-11.
The ICP filing number of the entity is Beijing ICP Filing No. 11018762.
