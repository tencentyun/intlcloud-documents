### Why do I have to apply for ICP filing transfer to Tencent Cloud for my domain name that has already obtained ICP filing through another access provider?
* Pursuant to the State Council Decree No. 292 and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Order No. 33 "Measures for the Archival Administration of Non-operational Internet Information Services", China implements a filing system for non-operational internet information services. The ICP filing information needs to be linked to the access service provider. If your entity has already obtained an ICP filing number through another provider, your website can engage in content services within the service scope offered by the provider.
* If you switch from the provider to Tencent Cloud, you need to transfer your ICP filing to Tencent Cloud and after that, your website can engage in content services through Tencent Cloud.
* If you use servers of multiple providers simultaneously, the original ICP filing does not need to be deregistered or changed as multiple access providers can exist at the same time. If you haven't obtained ICP filing for your domain name through a corresponding access provider, you cannot engage in content services through the provider. In order to ensure safe and compliant operations of your business, please complete the application process in accordance with applicable requirements.

### When is application for ICP filing transfer required?
If an entity has obtained ICP filing for its website through another access provider and now needs to bind the website to a Tencent Cloud server, it has to apply for ICP filing transfer in Tencent Cloud's ICP filing application system.
