### When do I have to apply for ICP filing?

- If the domain name of a website points to a server in mainland China, ICP filing must be obtained.
- If the domain name is used for email service (i.e., accessing organizational mailbox through "mail.domain name"), ICP filing must be obtained.

### How can you tell whether ICP filing was obtained? By domain name or port 80?

You can tell by the domain name. Domain names connected to the internet but do not have ICP filings will be detected and blocked, regardless of ports used.

### Does the server provider have to be the domain name registrar?

No.

### How many websites or domain names can I apply for ICP filing at a time?

Up to 10 websites can be included in one application, and up to 10 domain names can be added to one website. 

### What types of website can an individual operate?

Individuals can only operate personal blogs and other similar personal websites.

### Why do I have to apply for ICP filing transfer to Tencent Cloud for my domain name that has already obtained ICP filing through another access provider?

Pursuant to the State Council Decree No. 292 and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Order No. 33 "Measures for the Archival Administration of Non-operational Internet Information Services", China implements a filing system for non-operational internet information services. 

The ICP filing information needs to be linked to the access service provider. If your entity has already obtained an ICP filing number through another provider, your website can engage in content services within the service scope offered by the provider. If you switch from the provider to Tencent Cloud, you need to transfer your ICP filing to Tencent Cloud. After that, your website can engage in content services through Tencent Cloud. 

If you use servers of multiple providers simultaneously, the original ICP filing does not need to be deregistered or changed as multiple access providers can exist at the same time. 

If you haven't obtained ICP filing for your domain name through a corresponding access provider, your domain name will be identified as not filed, and you cannot engage in content services through the provider. 

In order to ensure safe and compliant operations of your business, please complete the application process in accordance with applicable requirements. 

### After I purchase a Tencent Cloud server, can I resolve my domain name to it without applying for ICP filing?

- If the purchased server is outside mainland China, no ICP filing is required and the domain name can be directly resolved;
- If the purchased server is located in mainland China, the system will perform automatic detection, and if the domain name has no ICP filing information at Tencent Cloud, it will be blocked. In order not to affect the normal use of your website, please complete the ICP filing application process as soon as possible. 

### Can I add a new entity to an account that has already been used to apply for ICP filing?
One account can be used to apply for ICP filing for websites of one entity only. If you need to apply for ICP filing for a new entity, please register a new account or use the ICP filing authorization code to submit the application.

### Is ICP filing application for new website faster than first-time ICP filing application?

They have the same process with little difference in timing.

### If I apply for ICP filing for my domain name using a master node of Tencent Cloud in Beijing, can the domain name be normally accessed from master nodes in other regions?
Yes.
### I have already obtained a personal ICP filing using my identity card number. Can I be the person-in-charge of the website when applying for an organizational ICP filing?

Individual and organization are two different entities for ICP filing application. Even if you have already obtained a personal ICP filing, you can still be the person-in-charge of the website when applying for an organizational ICP filing; however, you cannot be the person-in-charge of the website at multiple organizations.
