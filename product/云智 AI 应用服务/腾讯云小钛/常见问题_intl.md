### Can one bot be associated with multiple websites and WeChat Official Accounts?

A: Yes. There is no limit for the number of channels that one bot can be associated with, so it can be associated with multiple websites and WeChat Official Accounts, and the answers to the same question are the same in different channels. If the knowledge points vary for different channels, we recommend purchasing multiple bots for multiple channels.
