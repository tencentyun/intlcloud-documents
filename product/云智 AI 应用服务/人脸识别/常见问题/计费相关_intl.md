### Does Face Recognition offer API calls per month for free?
Yes. Each API can be called 10,000 times per month free of charge. Billing starts after the free quota is exceeded.

### How is Face Recognition billed?
It is billed according to a tiered structure. The fees will be calculated based on the unit price in the corresponding tier in the current month. The more times the APIs are called, the lower the unit price. For more information, see [Face Recognition Pricing](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/867/17640).

### Why is an amount frozen when the payment is deducted?
Face Recognition is pay-as-you-go, i.e., the payment for calls in the current month will be deducted on the first day of the next month, and the service will be stopped once your account falls into arrears. In order to ensure smooth operations of your business, an amount equal to 120% of the bill amount will be frozen during settlement. Therefore, it is recommended that you top up your account in a timely manner based on your business needs.
