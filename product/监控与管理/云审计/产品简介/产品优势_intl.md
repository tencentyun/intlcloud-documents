| Advantage | Description |
|:--------:|------------|
| High efficiency | CloudAudit stores users' operation data in Tencent Cloud, eliminating your need of importing the data to your PC. Through Tencent cloud services, the computing tasks that would otherwise be executed on the local machine are pushed to the server, which assigns the computing tasks to free computers across cloud network, and returns the received results to the local machine, thus saving a lot of time. |
| Compatibility | With CloudAudit, data and programs are stored in Tencent Cloud, and the design, maintenance and upgrade of audit programs are no longer undertaken by users, but are completely taken care of by professional cloud software providers. This greatly improves the compatibility of audit software. |
| Data Sharing | All the user information collected and all the data captured and generated are no longer stored in blocks on the user side, but are classified and stored in a single resource platform. CloudAudit platform allows you to query all the data and information collected by the platform at any time, and share the audit information in time to avoid redundant work. |
| Real-time | You can keep track of the operation progress and check logs as needed. You can also learn about your operation behaviors and report the problems encountered in the operation process to administrators. In addition, you can get informed of others' situation to facilitate the sharing of clues and methods. |
| Supervision | CloudAudit can help administrators get a full picture of operations by each user in a timely manner and then work on the next task in a focused way. Users can also supervise each other to improve the audit quality. |  
| Compliance | By effectively recording all the operations under a Tencent Cloud account in real time, CloudAudit can pinpoint problems or faults, and manage deployment changes for traceability, thus ensuring the security and compliance of business running on Tencent Cloud. |
