## Security Analysis
When your cloud account or resource has a security problem, the logs recorded by CloudAudit can help you analyze the reasons. For example, CloudAudit records all of your account login operations, operation time, source IP address, and whether or not multi-factor authentication is used, all of which have detailed records, through which you can determine whether the account has a security problem.
## Resource Change Tracking
In case of any abnormal change in your resources, you can identify the cause using the operation logs recorded by CloudAudit. For example, if one of your CVM instances is shut down, you can find the operation time and source IP address through CloudAudit to analyze the initiated shutdown operation.
## Compliance Audit
If your organization has multiple members and you have used Tencent Cloud CAM service to manage the identities of these members, you need to obtain the detailed operation records of each member to meet the new compliance audit need of your organization. The operation events recorded by CloudAudit can help you meet the compliance audit requirement.
