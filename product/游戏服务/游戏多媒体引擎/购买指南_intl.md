Game Multimedia Engine (GME) currently offers live voice chat, voice messaging and speech-to-text converter. See below for the rates.


## Live Voice Chat
Standard voice chat is billed by voice DAU. HD voice chat is billed by voice duration.

- We recommend standard sound quality for battle or casual games.
- We recommend HD sound quality for live voice broadcasting or online karaoke.
- For PCU billing, please contact our sales rep for details.
### Free Quota
There are free quotas for both billing methods of the live voice chat service.
- Billed by voice DAUs: free of charge if the daily DAU is below 100.
- Billed by voice duration: free of charge if the daily duration is below 300 minutes.

After reaching free quotas, fees apply based on your utilization.

> If an application has 150 minutes voice duration on a day (< 300 minutes), the service will be free of charge. If it has 1,000 minutes, the billable duration would be 0.94 USD (based on the voice duration unit price of 0.94 USD/1,000 minutes).

- A voice DAU is counted when a user enters a room in the application. The total number of voice DAUs is based on deduplicated openIDs (openID is a unique user identifier in the application; one user is associated with one openID).
- Voice duration is calculated based on the time a user enters and exits the room. If user A enters a voice room at 12:00, user B enters the room at 12:30, and both of them exit the room at 12:40, the duration of voice use would be 50 minutes in total (40 minutes for user A and 10 minutes for user B).

## Voice Messaging and Speech-to-text Converter
Voice messaging and speech-to-text converter billings are based on voice message DAUs.
