## Operation Scenario

This document guides you through the process of removing a node from a cluster.

## Considerations

- A pay-as-you-go node can be retained or terminated as you wish, but if it is not terminated, fees will continue to be incurred.
- Keep in mind that if a node is removed from and then added back to the cluster, the system will be reinstalled. 

## Directions

1. Log in to the [TKE console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2).
2. In the left sidebar, click **[Clusters](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/cluster?rid=1)** to go to the cluster management page.
3. Click the ID/name of the cluster where node needs to be removed to enter the cluster management page. See the figure below:
