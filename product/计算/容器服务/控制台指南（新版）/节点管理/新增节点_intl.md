### Creating a Node

1. In the left sidebar, click **[Clusters](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/cluster)** to go to the **Cluster Management** page.
2. Click the ID of the cluster that you want to create CVMs in it. Select **Node Management** > **Node**, and click **Create Node**.
3. In the **Select Model** page, select the availability zone, node network and instance type, etc., according to the actual requirements. The only billing mode that is supported is **Pay as you go**. This is shown in the following figure:

4. Click **Next**.
5. In the **CVM Configuration** page, configure the CVM. This is shown in the following figure:
   ![CVM configuration](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/2f2a5f425d1febc80940611d5d02decc.png)
   Main parameters include:

- Operating system: The operating system is at the cluster level. You can go to the cluster details page to modify it. After modification, newly added or reinstalled nodes will use the new operating system.
- System disk: Select local disk, HDD cloud disk, premium cloud disk, or SSD cloud disk based on actual requirements.
- Data disk: Select based on actual requirements.
- Public network bandwidth: Provides **Bill-by-traffic** billing method.
- Node Name:
  - Automatic naming: The CVM instance will be automatically named in the format of ccs_cluster id_node.
  - Manual naming: Enter a custom instance name of up to 60 characters.
- Login method:
  - Set a password: Set a corresponding password as prompted.
  - SSH Key Pair: A key pair is a pair of parameters generated by an algorithm. It is a way to log in to a CVM instance more secure than regular passwords. For details, see [SSH Key](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/6092).
  - Random Password: A password will be automatically generated and sent to you through internal message.
- Security Group: Used to set the network access control of the CVM instance. Please select based on actual needs. You can click **Create security group** to open other ports to the internet.

6. Click **Next**.
7. On the **Confirm Info** page, confirm the selected configuration information. Set the number of CVM instances, and click **Complete**.

### Adding an Existing Node

> ! Currently, you can only add CVM instances in the same VPC.

1. In the left sidebar, click **[Clusters](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/cluster)** to go to the **Cluster Management** page.
2. Click the cluster ID of the existing node you want to add to enter the cluster details page.
3. Select **Node Management** > **Node**, and click **Add Existing Node**. This is shown in the following figure:

4. On the **Select a node** page, select the node to be added and click **Next**.
5. On the **CVM Configuration** page, configure the CVM instance to be added to the cluster.
   Main parameters include:

- Data disk settings: Select **Store containers and images on a data disk**.
  - Set Later: Do not set the storage path of containers and images. If the system disk capacity is large enough, a CVM instance with no data disk is used, or the data disk needs to be manually mounted before use. We recommend that you do not set the container directory.
  - Store containers and images on a data disk: If the system disk capacity is small, or a server with a data disk needs to accept data disk formatting, you can choose to set the storage directory of containers and images.
- OS: Select based on actual needs.
- Login method:
  - Set a password: Set a corresponding password as prompted.
  - SSH Key Pair: A key pair is a pair of parameters generated by an algorithm. It is a way to log in to a CVM instance more secure than regular passwords. For details, see [SSH Key](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/6092).
  - Random Password: A password will be automatically generated and sent to you through internal message.
- Security group: Used to set the network access control of the CVM instance. Please select based on actual needs. You can click **Create security group** to open other ports to the internet.

6. Click **Finish**.
