Microsoft provides [Get started with Remote Desktop on Mac](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-mac) to describes two ways to obtain Microsoft Remote Desktop for Mac. You can choose one of the following 3 ways to get Remote Desktop for Mac OS: 
 1. Remote Desktop Beta client
We recommend downloading the beta client of the Remote Desktop for Mac provided by Microsoft from [Microsoft Remote Desktop for Mac](https://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/5e0c144289a51fca2d3bfa39ce7f2b06/). Please note that Microsoft removed the download link from its official website on 2017, and released this beta client at HockeyApp, a subsidiary of Microsoft.
