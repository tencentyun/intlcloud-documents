## Ticket System
If you encounter an OPS or technical problem when using the products, you can log in to the Tencent Cloud Console and follow on-screen prompts to submit a ticket. We will get back to you accordingly as soon as possible.
The following are ticket-related entry links:
- Submitting a ticket: [Submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category)
- Querying ticket state: [Ticket list](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder)

A ticket can have the following statuses:
- Pending processing: The ticket is just submitted or has been received but not reviewed by the technical support team. You can submit more information for or close the ticket at this stage.

- Processing: The technical support team has received and reviewed the ticket and is taking an action. You cannot do anything with the ticket at this stage.

- More information required: The technical support team has received and reviewed the ticket, but more information is required for processing it. You can close the ticket at this stage.
> Note: If you re-submit a ticket after providing more information, it will move to the "Pending processing" state.
- Closed: The ticket is solved or closed by you before the technical support team takes an action
