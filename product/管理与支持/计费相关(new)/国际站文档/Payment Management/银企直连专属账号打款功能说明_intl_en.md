With Tencent Cloud's beneficiary account bank transfer feature, you can apply for a unique Tencent Cloud bank transfer account to associate with your own account. The system will automatically send reports to the finance system based on your payment records and quickly top up your account. To enable bank transfers, go to **Billing Center** > **Payment Management** > **Payment** > **[Bank Transfer](https://console.tencentcloud.com/expense/recharge)**.

### Transfer Process
**Step 1. Query and enable the bank transfer beneficiary account**
Check whether bank transfers are enabled for your account. If enabled, you will see the bank transfer beneficiary account information, including the beneficiary account name and number, beneficiary bank, and SWIFT code.

Currently, the bank transfer feature is only available to users registered in regions listed in categories A and C in the [Region List and Beneficiary Address](#Region-List-and-Beneficiary-Address) section of this document.

**Step 2. Use the Bank Transfer beneficiary account to make a Tencent Cloud payment offline**
You can transfer funds directly to your beneficiary account, and the system will automatically check for the transfer. Make sure you enter all the information correctly.
A bank transfer usually takes 3–5 business days to complete, depending on the specific bank's system.

**Step 3. Query the payment information and progress**
To query the information and progress of a payment, go to **Billing Center** > **Payment Management** > **[Bank Transfer Query](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/expense/payment/transfer)**.
