## 1.  **Terms and Definitions**
1.1.  **Global Application Acceleration Platform Service provided by Tencent Cloud:** means the service enables users to access the origin server through a high-speed connection with the aid of the nearest node by leveraging Tencent Cloud's high-speed connections, forwarding clusters and intelligent routing technology for global nodes, which helps eliminate the stutters and latency experienced by global users when accessing businesses.
    

1.2.  **Service Unavailable:** When all attempted communications made by you within one minute via accelerated connection fail within the accelerated connection for reasons attributable to Tencent Cloud (i.e., the packet loss rate is 100% within such one minute for such accelerated connection, which data shall be subject to monitoring data of Tencent Cloud), the accelerated connection service during such one minute shall be deemed unavailable.
    
1.3  **Service Downtime:** The sum of the unavailable minutes of the accelerated connection during a Service Month shall be the service downtime for such Service Month.
    
1.4.  **Service Month(s):** Service Month(s) means the calendar month(s) within the term of the Service purchased by you. For example, if you purchase the Service for a term of three months starting from March 17, there will be four (4) Service Months (the first Service Month from March 17 to March 31, the second from April 1 to April 30, the third from May 1 to May 31, and the fourth from June 1 to June 16). The availability of the Service will be calculated independently for each Service Month.

3.1.  **Standards of Compensation**

(1) Compensations will be made in the form of voucher by Tencent Cloud, and you should follow the rules for using the voucher (including the valid term; for details, please refer to the rules of vouchers published on Tencent Cloud's official website). You cannot redeem such voucher for cash or request to issue an invoice for such voucher. Such voucher can only be used to purchase the Service by using your Tencent Cloud account. You cannot use the voucher to purchase other services of Tencent Cloud, nor should you give the voucher to a third party for consideration or for free.

(2) If the Service Availability for a Service Month fails to meet the standard, the amount of compensation will be calculated for such month independently, and the aggregate amount shall be no more than the applicable Monthly Service Fee paid by you for such month (the Monthly Service Fee referred herein shall exclude the portion deducted by a voucher or promotional credit, due to discounted service fee or otherwise deducted).

|-|-|
|≥ 99% and \< 99.95%|     10% of the Monthly Service Fee|
|≥ 95% and \< 99%|      25% of the Monthly Service Fee|

(1) If the Service Availability for a Service Month fails to meet the abovementioned Service Availability standard, you may apply for compensation through (and only through) the support ticket system under your relevant account after the fifth (5^th^) business day of the month immediately following such Service Month. Tencent Cloud will verify and ascertain your application upon receipt of such application. If there is any dispute over the calculation of the Service Availability for a Service Month, both parties agree that the back-end record of Tencent Cloud will prevail.

(2) You should apply for such compensation no later than sixty (60) calendar days following the expiry of the applicable Service Month in which the Service Availability fails to meet the standard. If you fail to make any application within such period, or make the application after such period, or make the application by any means other than that agreed herein, it shall be deemed that you have voluntarily waived your right to apply for such compensation and any other rights you may have against Tencent Cloud, in which case Tencent Cloud has the right to reject your application for compensation and not to make any compensation to you.
