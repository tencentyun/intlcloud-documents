Tencent LVB services will stop in 24 hours when your account is in arrears. You will receive notifications to top up your account within 24 hours. Your service will not be affected if you top up your account within 24 hours.
If you do not top up your account within 24 hours, the VOD files generated by LVB recording will not be accessible. The LVB screenshots stored in COS will also be processed according to COS's [arrears policy](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/10044).
If you no longer intend to continue Tencent Cloud LVB services and wish to deactivate the service, please contact your Tencent Cloud business manager or raise a [ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).
