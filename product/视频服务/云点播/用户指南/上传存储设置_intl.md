The category and storage region management in the upload/storage settings helps you manage the files in the VOD console.

## Category Management

You can create, delete, and rename file categories in **Upload Storage** > **Category Management**. In category management, you can also view, modify, delete and associate files via API.

>?**You can manage the categories on the file/video information management page.**

- **Add a top-level category:** Click **Add Category** to add a new top-level category (default name: "New top-level category"). To rename a category, select the category you want to rename, click the **Edit** icon next to the number of files, enter the desired name and click **OK**.
- **Add a Sub-category:** To add a sub-category under a category, click **Add Sub-category** on the right of the category list. Currently, the system supports four levels of categories; therefore, you cannot add a sub-category under a level-4 category. To rename a category, select the category, click the **Edit** icon next to the number of files, enter the desired name, and click **OK**.
- **Delete a category:** Click **Delete** on the right of the category and confirm. The files under the deleted category will go to category "**Other**".

## Storage Region Management

Tencent Cloud VOD is available in multiple regions. You can store your resources in multiple regions, but you can set only one region as the default region. When enabling a region, that region cannot be configured. Once enabled, the region cannot be closed. You can activate regions according to your needs, and the system will store the files according to the region policy you configured.

> ?If you need to activate an overseas region (Hong Kong, Singapore, Moscow, Frankfurt, Mumbai, and Seoul), please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).
