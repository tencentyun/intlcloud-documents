## Access Statistics

    - Total independent IP access requests: The number of unique requests received. The duplicated IP of the request are removed in the logs.

        - The domain name statistics are calculated using unique IPs of the requests on a daily basis. If there are multiple domain names, the statistics are counted by accumulating the daily active quantity of every domain name with a 5-minute granularity.
    - Total requests: The total number of requests received by the domain name in a given time period.
- Graphs/figures display the request count and unique IP request trends, the requests by ISP ratio, and the top 10 provinces where the requests were sent.
